430,0,3,0.265000,i'm fine thank you
430,0,3,0.214000,i am from los angeles
430,0,3,0.180000,well you can't beat the weather
430,0,3,0.785000,um and
430,0,3,0.234286,i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here
430,0,3,0.510000,smog
430,0,3,0.480000,uh
430,0,3,0.303333,rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's
430,0,3,0.460000,um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude
430,0,3,0.283684,um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no
430,0,3,0.316250,i just think seeing different places it's um
430,0,3,0.289231,learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest
430,0,3,0.800000,um
430,0,3,0.260000,let's see
430,0,3,0.217703,i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um
430,0,3,0.340769,being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger
430,0,3,0.311429,and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh
430,0,3,0.251875,it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh
430,0,3,0.237778,i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat
430,0,3,0.250000,too many to mention i i don't even know where to start
430,0,3,0.248333,suppose it depends on the situation
430,0,3,0.650000,um
430,0,3,0.285294,i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading
430,0,3,0.263333,uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh
430,0,3,0.304000,you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax
430,0,3,0.710000,<sigh>
430,0,3,0.273750,in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter>
430,0,3,0.295000,ah probably argued with my roommate
430,0,3,0.270000,<psh> couple days ago but uh
430,0,3,0.261429,that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will
430,0,3,0.279333,uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of
430,0,3,0.590000,um
430,0,3,0.204545,kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along
430,0,3,0.197500,it's cool i mean
430,0,3,0.277500,guess you know like
430,0,3,0.268519,we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool
430,0,3,0.250000,hmm
430,0,3,0.185000,how much time do we have
430,0,3,0.360000,uh <laughter>
430,0,3,0.322857,it's just too numerous to mention um
430,0,3,0.170556,i i i wouldn't know how to answer that
430,0,3,0.364000,i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly
430,0,3,0.405000,cared about but knowing
430,0,3,0.216667,knowing that it just wasn't going to work um
430,0,3,0.242500,that was very difficult
430,0,3,0.337500,just weighed pros and cons and just thought
430,0,3,0.211429,it just wasn't going to work um
430,0,3,0.296667,no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship
430,0,3,0.222500,there was something missing
430,0,3,0.285833,and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and
430,0,3,0.168000,just knew it was over
430,0,3,0.180000,no
430,0,3,0.300625,so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory
430,0,3,0.299375,oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that
430,0,3,0.260000,the same girl
430,0,3,0.176000,that i broke up with
430,0,3,0.337500,she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine
430,0,3,0.353333,uh they were separated for for
430,0,3,0.505000,several years
430,0,3,0.328182,and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i
430,0,3,0.236000,i would've handled that better
430,0,3,0.330000,<scoff>
430,0,3,0.590000,um
430,0,3,0.219375,it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i
430,0,3,0.263333,my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister
430,0,3,0.276667,my older sister
430,0,3,0.620000,um
430,0,3,0.355000,she's just
430,0,3,0.537500,strong no nonsense uh
430,0,3,0.296429,she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh
430,0,3,0.500000,uh
430,0,3,0.196667,she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way
430,0,3,0.250000,uh suppose it depends on my stress level
430,0,3,0.610000,um
430,0,3,0.136250,when i have a lot on my mind
430,0,3,0.281000,i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just
430,0,3,0.255862,if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep
430,0,3,0.353750,crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um
430,0,3,0.440000,tired
430,0,3,0.341333,listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well
430,0,3,0.146667,i feel good
430,0,3,0.410000,mm no not really um
430,0,3,0.208333,no no i i wouldn't say
430,0,3,0.235000,i have
430,0,3,0.190000,no i have not
430,0,3,0.203333,yes i have
430,0,3,0.268000,i was diagnosed probably about
430,0,3,0.205000,about five years ago
430,0,3,0.281000,i think uh i always knew there was a problem
430,0,3,0.223333,i always knew there was some
430,0,3,0.228333,i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that
430,0,3,0.280000,there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain
430,0,3,0.280000,and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help
430,0,3,0.373333,think just uh
430,0,3,0.820000,lethargy uh
430,0,3,0.398333,uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there
430,0,3,0.590000,um
430,0,3,0.443333,think normal depression type things uh
430,0,3,0.570000,um
430,0,3,0.270250,social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was
430,0,3,0.230000,you know quite talkative <laughter>
430,0,3,0.185000,i do
430,0,3,0.227500,i'm sorry say again
430,0,3,0.255000,gotcha um it does i think it does
430,0,3,0.543333,well um <sigh>
430,0,3,0.262500,i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to
430,0,3,0.321667,to step back from certain situations
430,0,3,0.415000,and not take them so seriously
430,0,3,0.312857,and not get so tense or angry
430,0,3,0.410000,and then react
430,0,3,0.208333,i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part
430,0,3,0.392500,now it's becoming it it it's becoming routine
430,0,3,0.306667,uh initially it was very difficult
430,0,3,0.530000,when i was five years old <laughter>
430,0,3,0.231667,oh no when <wh> when you're a kid there's nothing really to
430,0,3,0.630000,um
430,0,3,0.222222,there's nothing to be sad about you're a kid
430,0,3,0.256667,my best friend
430,0,3,0.640000,um
430,0,3,0.194000,a jerk i don't yeah
430,0,3,0.203125,uh i have a dry i have a dry sense of humor so uh you know
430,0,3,0.273333,my best friend would probably uh
430,0,3,0.196667,i think the
430,0,3,0.240556,the banter back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know it's all in love
430,0,3,0.278571,um i wish i could be taller
430,0,3,0.163333,i wish i could be more
430,0,3,0.300000,inclined to play basketball so i then become go to the n_b_a and be a millionaire i know that's all unrealistic but just answering honestly
430,0,3,0.450000,hmm
430,0,3,0.272222,anything i regret haven't we asked asked this before i mean so many don't know where to start
430,0,3,0.244000,mm that's a good one
430,0,3,0.460000,wow
430,0,3,0.720000,um
430,0,3,0.187500,wow i don't know
430,0,3,0.183929,i you know that's a good one i'd have <ha> i'd have to think about that i don't i wouldn't wanna answer that uh that's a good one
430,0,3,0.285000,usually you're asked um
430,0,3,0.241739,what you'd what you know how you feel ten twenty years from now looking back i don't know what advice i'd give myself
430,0,3,0.432500,something i really enjoyed
430,0,3,0.640000,um
430,0,3,0.255000,hmm i love um
430,0,3,0.249884,there are several things i like to do um uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i i love watching it i love watching all sports for that matter what brings me real joy the past few years was um
430,0,3,0.337750,become a hobby of mine is is uh rescuing dogs fostering dogs and finding them them homes uh it's <laughter>
430,0,3,0.206667,i guess it's become quite a a hobby of mine and uh
430,0,3,0.243600,sometimes i find lost dogs and i'm able to find their owner and sometimes i'm not so when i'll tell you what there's nothing <noth>
430,0,3,0.226216,to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found eh there is not greater feeling 'cause the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his um
430,0,3,0.225000,how his <hi> how his daughter
430,0,3,0.229545,or was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool
430,0,3,0.329474,i think for somebody that um didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that
430,0,3,0.295000,i uh
430,0,3,0.185000,i take
430,0,3,0.241667,pride in though i don't show it or speak about it often

341,0,7,0.365000,no <laughter>

341,0,7,0.412500,other than that um

341,0,7,0.475000,no <laughter>
341,0,7,0.401667,um the hardest thing is um
341,0,7,0.303333,raising a child with a disability
341,0,7,0.248571,not knowing how you can help him
341,0,7,0.350000,it is it's very hard
341,0,7,0.215000,i don't sugarcoat it at all
341,0,7,0.327500,just having my children
341,0,7,0.297143,they're a blessing i love 'em <laughter>
341,0,7,0.287200,with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and i just love the fact that i'm helping mold them into 
341,0,7,0.402500,good human beings <laughter>
341,0,7,0.346667,we're really close
341,0,7,0.258824,i mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close 
341,0,7,0.293333,good or bad
341,0,7,0.250000,<laughter>
341,0,7,0.740000,most memorable
341,0,7,0.295455,just giving birth for the first time it was just amazing
341,0,7,0.241429,my son is nine now so i still remember it like it was yesterday
341,0,7,0.350000,<laughter>
341,0,7,0.396667,like i was
341,0,7,0.309286,being born again myself i don't know how to explain it it just very
341,0,7,0.665000,emotional <laughter>
341,0,7,0.360000,i don't know <laughter> i guess i have a lot of regrets but
341,0,7,0.305556,none that i really wanna mention i guess <laughter>
341,0,7,0.672500,stay in school <laughter> don't get emotionally involved
341,0,7,0.470000,and um let people
341,0,7,0.441667,deter you from your goals <laughter>
341,0,7,0.280000,oh yeah
341,0,7,0.580000,definitely
341,0,7,0.152000,did you wanna move on
341,0,7,0.350000,i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing 
341,0,7,0.269167,for the most part i don't really have a temper per se
341,0,7,0.285000,things frustrate me more than they anger me
341,0,7,0.240000,xxx
341,0,7,0.392000,oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um
341,0,7,0.348889,i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to
341,0,7,0.526000,socialize <laughter> she feels that
341,0,7,0.279000,i'm married with children so i should stay at home
341,0,7,0.308571,like ninety nine percent of the time
341,0,7,0.321667,and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers
341,0,7,0.220000,and she
341,0,7,0.820000,basically
341,0,7,0.252222,kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter> 
341,0,7,0.670000,it does
341,0,7,0.262500,and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her
341,0,7,0.209048,because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day
341,0,7,0.290000,but
341,0,7,0.376667,she gets kinda intrusive <laughter> i don't know <laughter>
341,0,7,0.290714,oh i know um after the semester ended when i noted that i 
341,0,7,0.218696,you know i did well in school 'cause i had been it had been a long time since i went to school so

341,0,7,0.240000,thank you
341,0,7,0.343462,my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes
341,0,7,0.225000,you know she gets a little
341,0,7,0.248400,like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and 
341,0,7,0.166667,pretty much have to let me do what i need to do
341,0,7,0.365000,<sigh> a lotta 
341,0,7,0.365714,heavy breathing <laughter> i mean i walk sometimes when i get a lil' frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk

341,0,7,0.288571,you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my
341,0,7,0.248333,enlistment and then i got out
341,0,7,0.261429,it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs
341,0,7,0.256667,um just made me a little bit more responsible

341,0,7,0.303333,you know so
341,0,7,0.192174,all i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do <laughter> 
341,0,7,0.650000,um
341,0,7,0.236667,i don't know
341,0,7,0.173750,<laughter> i never really thought about it 
341,0,7,0.234737,i guess it just you know being around my kids you know i just love being around my children

341,0,7,0.285000,it's not all bad
341,0,7,0.245714,i mean he has challenges eh but i'm dealing with them a lot better
341,0,7,0.271481,you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know
341,0,7,0.339412,different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it
341,0,7,0.220000,thank you
341,0,7,0.270000,no

425,0,6,0.258571,things are <sigh> things are a little
425,0,6,0.380000,shaky for me
425,0,6,0.302857,i'm staying with my son in venice
425,0,6,0.321200,uh it's pretty good but uh both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live
425,0,6,0.425000,originally from new york but i've been in california since the early seventies so
425,0,6,0.450000,yeah
425,0,6,0.286842,uh i moved to l_a because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be
425,0,6,0.395000,um it wasn't too hard i uh i met people right away and um
425,0,6,0.238824,i just really like it here so it was uh it was easy to connect with people
425,0,6,0.291875,the weather is <laughter> number one like for most people i love being near the ocean
425,0,6,0.650000,um
425,0,6,0.330769,i like the energy i like the um i like the artistic culture
425,0,6,0.420000,mhm
425,0,6,0.270000,uh well everybody loves the traffic i mean loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kinda feel <fee> i feel the same way um
425,0,6,0.370000,sometimes it
425,0,6,0.338947,it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult
425,0,6,0.317826,uh no not as much as i'd like if if i had more funds <fu> more income more funds i would travel more
425,0,6,0.490000,um <sigh> well mostly i've been um
425,0,6,0.412727,xxx i traveled let's see so my longest uh trip that
425,0,6,0.275455,was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled
425,0,6,0.390000,drove down with a friend uh down to oaxaca
425,0,6,0.317273,and the whole trip we took about mm i think we
425,0,6,0.319286,took us about four weeks going down and back from uh the bay area
425,0,6,0.191429,um yeah that was a fun trip
425,0,6,0.414231,well uh we'd been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her
425,0,6,0.278125,um from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for day of the dead
425,0,6,0.339091,so it was uh celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and
425,0,6,0.360769,everybody in the village makes an altar in their house uh for their
425,0,6,0.251429,uh loved ones who have passed away
425,0,6,0.585000,and um
425,0,6,0.351613,they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that
425,0,6,0.480000,uh
425,0,6,0.313438,well i studied <studi> i was in the liberal liberal arts program but i didn't stay <st> i stayed only stayed in school for uh in college for a couple of years
425,0,6,0.309167,um but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities
425,0,6,0.482727,huh my dream job would be uh personal assisting somebody who
425,0,6,0.444000,was in a creative field
425,0,6,0.452727,and getting to uh travel and go to events with them
425,0,6,0.453636,uh it's hard to break into um i i'm starting now very uh minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a
425,0,6,0.900000,volunteer
425,0,6,0.277273,work with and i'm i'm working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that
425,0,6,0.397407,i'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so um i i'm you know i have no trouble meeting people uh i don't hold back and um
425,0,6,0.218421,you know xxx just i'm not shy <sh> like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people
425,0,6,0.580000,um
425,0,6,0.449000,but i i am overall kind of introverted so um
425,0,6,0.473333,i prefer one-on-one
425,0,6,0.350000,than
425,0,6,0.390000,big groups
425,0,6,0.600000,um
425,0,6,0.356667,i like to watch uh well i <laughter> i like to watch uh improvement shows like on uh h_g_t_v i like to watch um
425,0,6,0.474545,like remodel shows and and see transformations or or watch movies
425,0,6,0.295000,or read
425,0,6,0.393846,oh and and i play some solitaire on my uh my kindle fire
425,0,6,0.620000,um
425,0,6,0.367647,i don't usually realize i'm mad until later <laughter> so <laughter> it doesn't really come up um
425,0,6,0.318462,and i i just tend not to have the kind of life where
425,0,6,0.640000,um
425,0,6,0.481818,those situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road
425,0,6,0.334800,um i get a little annoyed uh i don't get annoyed so much at like when people cut me off or anything like that um
425,0,6,0.403750,but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um
425,0,6,0.310000,you know when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and they <the> you know like
425,0,6,0.270000,they get really angry then that makes me angry in return
425,0,6,0.625000,hmm <sigh>
425,0,6,0.610000,um
425,0,6,0.345455,yeah like i said i don't really get into arguments um
425,0,6,0.297857,i did have <ha> i was with a friend the other day and um
425,0,6,0.330000,she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her
425,0,6,0.413750,so it wasn't really an argument but she
425,0,6,0.247143,you know i had said something that
425,0,6,0.257000,she heard as a correction well it was a correction
425,0,6,0.506667,and she got angry um but
425,0,6,0.680000,um
425,0,6,0.310909,well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable
425,0,6,0.326667,eh i wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable
425,0,6,0.630000,hmm
425,0,6,1.010000,um
425,0,6,0.320000,well i
425,0,6,0.420000,in that situation
425,0,6,0.251250,i didn't i didn't have to correct her
425,0,6,0.500000,um
425,0,6,0.675000,so <sigh>
425,0,6,0.346471,i think that's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right
425,0,6,0.450000,so in general
425,0,6,0.396250,that's i'm trying to to catch that and
425,0,6,0.320000,just let people
425,0,6,0.276000,make mistakes without <laughter> without my telling them about it
425,0,6,0.330000,mm
425,0,6,0.330000,hmm
425,0,6,0.428000,boy i don't know um
425,0,6,0.380000,gee that's tough
425,0,6,0.385000,i can't i don't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions um
425,0,6,0.380000,hmm
425,0,6,0.562500,well uh <u> uh
425,0,6,0.630000,was
425,0,6,0.276000,hard for me to decide
425,0,6,0.620000,to uh
425,0,6,0.257778,put my cat to sleep when he was sick
425,0,6,0.193846,oh it was <wa> and i had to give up a cat um
425,0,6,0.248333,when i was moving once and
425,0,6,0.405000,and that was difficult too 'cause
425,0,6,0.920000,um <sigh>
425,0,6,0.202857,well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick um
425,0,6,0.498000,i decided when the vet
425,0,6,0.347778,said that he thought it was the humane decision
425,0,6,0.300000,um
425,0,6,0.210909,and with the cat i had to give up i didn't
425,0,6,0.790000,i
425,0,6,0.364545,didn't really decide um i was moving to a place that
425,0,6,0.228000,where i couldn't take her
425,0,6,0.600000,and so i
425,0,6,0.250000,i found somebody who could take her
425,0,6,0.545000,hmm <sigh>
425,0,6,0.690000,mm
425,0,6,0.620000,see
425,0,6,1.280000,um
425,0,6,0.346667,gee that's tough
425,0,6,0.640000,<sigh>
425,0,6,0.360000,if i don't really eh the the erasing from the memory part um
425,0,6,0.270000,there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory
425,0,6,0.680000,um
425,0,6,0.214000,trying to think of something that i've done that i
425,0,6,0.315000,wish i hadn't done
425,0,6,0.500000,um
425,0,6,0.214375,oh okay i remember something there was <wa> <laughter> there was a time when i was
425,0,6,0.380000,i was in a class at junior college it was a film class
425,0,6,0.710000,and uh
425,0,6,0.343000,i was i was the one who was um after we we went out and did a little film project
425,0,6,0.490000,um
425,0,6,0.283333,and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week uh i was the one who had the film
425,0,6,0.543333,and through different
425,0,6,0.207000,just things that were happening in my life right now i never went back to the school but i never
425,0,6,0.312500,brought them the film back so all the work they had done
425,0,6,0.249286,um they had to do over again and i still feel bad about that
425,0,6,0.364444,eh it's pretty easy um sometimes i wake up
425,0,6,0.327222,in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often
425,0,6,0.389444,i've been feeling kind of tired and low level depressed and like not feeling a lot of options
425,0,6,0.300000,no
425,0,6,0.286667,yes i have
425,0,6,0.437333,uh well there were two times there was once um back in like nineteen seventy
425,0,6,0.420000,two nineteen <ninetee> yeah about nine nineteen seventy two or three and then um
425,0,6,0.776667,another time um
425,0,6,0.311818,oh so then when would that've been about sixteen years ago
425,0,6,0.650000,um
425,0,6,0.560000,just feeling like there wasn't um
425,0,6,0.325000,you know feeling that feeling that things weren't gonna change
425,0,6,0.297000,if i didn't get some help and that if i
425,0,6,0.231053,i didn't have to you know that maybe if some <s> i got some medication that would help me
425,0,6,0.320000,um
425,0,6,0.197500,in the short term
425,0,6,0.250000,so
425,0,6,0.231429,i'm not going to therapy right now
425,0,6,0.331304,uh i was moving around a lot finances i wasn't really feeling the need um i'm starting to think it might be a
425,0,6,0.296667,an option again
425,0,6,0.327500,i feel like therapy can be useful yes
425,0,6,0.407143,well when i went to therapy um
425,0,6,0.384444,it was helpful to have somebody who listened and
425,0,6,0.480000,could also
425,0,6,0.504286,offer impartial suggestions for helping me to
425,0,6,0.226667,improve the way i was feeling
425,0,6,0.710000,<deep breath>
425,0,6,1.030000,um <sigh>
425,0,6,0.336250,well i was on the beach last weekend
425,0,6,0.375333,uh it was a beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and uh
425,0,6,0.298571,just relaxing and i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and
425,0,6,0.346667,i felt very happy and content
425,0,6,0.358000,uh i'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener
425,0,6,0.431818,and i'm intelligent and i have uh i have good ideas
425,0,6,0.945000,um <sigh>
425,0,6,0.610000,well i wish that uh
425,0,6,0.345556,sometimes i wish i was <wa> i was a harder worker um i'm not really willing to take
425,0,6,0.342000,low wage jobs even though
425,0,6,0.376000,i i need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything
425,0,6,0.580000,um
425,0,6,0.605000,and um
425,0,6,0.333043,i wish i could act i i said i had good ideas that um i have good ideas and i'm good at the
425,0,6,0.403333,uh the onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so
425,0,6,0.408889,a lot of those ideas get started but then
425,0,6,0.323333,i don't take them the distance
425,0,6,0.289231,that's probably the the thing i'd like to change about myself the most
425,0,6,0.249000,uh ten or twenty years ago i'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree
425,0,6,0.556667,finish my education
425,0,6,0.830000,um
425,0,6,0.642000,and be willing to um
425,0,6,0.335000,to work
425,0,6,0.461667,a regular job and to um
425,0,6,0.432500,to start putting money

380,1,10,0.401290,but but and he's letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible <horr> horrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon so
380,1,10,0.295000,i can't see your shoes actually
380,1,10,0.275000,uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything
380,1,10,0.323000,i enjoy the chance to get to like see other
380,1,10,0.430769,um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the
380,1,10,0.478000,the specificity of my own
380,1,10,0.362759,you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um
380,1,10,0.278953,i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing
380,1,10,0.380000,mhm
380,1,10,0.870000,uh okay um
380,1,10,0.980000,hmm
380,1,10,0.238571,putting me on the spot here ellie
380,1,10,0.860000,um
380,1,10,0.360000,let's see
380,1,10,0.950000,uh
380,1,10,0.646667,well um i
380,1,10,0.310909,it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess
380,1,10,0.463000,one of the last trips i did was to um
380,1,10,0.215600,i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw
380,1,10,0.254186,but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole
380,1,10,0.259167,like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally
380,1,10,0.487778,it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um
380,1,10,0.363214,unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so
380,1,10,0.505000,so um
380,1,10,0.309286,uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal
380,1,10,1.130000,hmm
380,1,10,0.430000,it's a tough question um
380,1,10,0.373333,one <on> um
380,1,10,0.510000,<makes clicking sound with mouth>
380,1,10,0.590000,i uh
380,1,10,0.890000,hmm
380,1,10,0.248333,you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that
380,1,10,0.210000,yeah
380,1,10,0.137500,come back to it
380,1,10,0.210000,yeah
380,1,10,0.150000,that's what i just said
380,1,10,0.260000,film
380,1,10,0.226667,you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know
380,1,10,0.297143,i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys
380,1,10,0.258611,and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls
380,1,10,0.590000,um
380,1,10,0.279259,and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and
380,1,10,0.268000,at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um
380,1,10,0.300250,like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in
380,1,10,0.450000,playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film
380,1,10,0.256250,like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always
380,1,10,0.266471,i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like
380,1,10,0.810000,um
380,1,10,0.451000,and uh and i never
380,1,10,0.258421,uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was
380,1,10,0.364444,fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars
380,1,10,0.250625,the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
380,1,10,0.284615,and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so
380,1,10,0.320000,i'm not really sure uh
380,1,10,0.427500,yeah it's it's it's
380,1,10,0.250833,um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film
380,1,10,0.720000,but
380,1,10,0.332857,uh i've always been fascinated by like
380,1,10,0.323750,how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general
380,1,10,0.283333,i am yes
380,1,10,0.357300,um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct
380,1,10,0.371667,and uh put <pu> put together
380,1,10,0.289389,and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make
380,1,10,0.746000,movies
380,1,10,0.200643,uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the
380,1,10,0.355000,all the processes but
380,1,10,0.214727,i guess the best parabole for that would be a director
380,1,10,0.538000,directing
380,1,10,0.218182,well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them
380,1,10,0.927000,um
380,1,10,1.197000,my
380,1,10,0.390000,i guess um
380,1,10,0.384286,it's funny you should ask ellie um
380,1,10,0.259459,i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't
380,1,10,0.477000,when away
380,1,10,0.189810,like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like
380,1,10,0.244053,i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like
380,1,10,0.325923,of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like
380,1,10,0.505400,um thinks positively about me
380,1,10,0.325857,um so it's i have like a
380,1,10,0.397000,a complicated relationship with my parents
380,1,10,0.182500,i mean <mea> and my family in general
380,1,10,0.369565,well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like
380,1,10,0.827000,um
380,1,10,0.377714,i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um
380,1,10,0.241935,i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like
380,1,10,0.654000,uh
380,1,10,0.500000,or inhibited person maybe um
380,1,10,0.289200,so i like to like
380,1,10,0.970000,until
380,1,10,0.209000,yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it
380,1,10,0.311714,um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed
380,1,10,0.289333,so now i you know i have a glass of wine and
380,1,10,0.316000,maybe watch a movie
380,1,10,0.690000,um
380,1,10,0.298313,i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um
380,1,10,0.339750,if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like
380,1,10,0.218176,then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might
380,1,10,0.309067,go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like
380,1,10,0.328333,you know competitive sports and hiking
380,1,10,0.210500,pretty good
380,1,10,0.420000,well i always like arguing um
380,1,10,0.355000,i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper
380,1,10,0.625000,um
380,1,10,0.589750,i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um
380,1,10,0.284667,but i don't
380,1,10,0.270800,as long as my like
380,1,10,0.351700,'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks
380,1,10,0.304846,uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject
380,1,10,0.642000,um
380,1,10,0.291667,and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think
380,1,10,0.657000,um
380,1,10,0.254500,one of my weaker points i would say
380,1,10,0.225000,but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question
380,1,10,1.074000,um
380,1,10,0.204867,what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate
380,1,10,0.427000,hmm
380,1,10,0.282500,the last time i had a heated debate
380,1,10,0.582250,was um i had a heated debate about
380,1,10,0.402000,uh the movie boogie nights
380,1,10,0.809000,um
380,1,10,0.288526,i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about
380,1,10,0.205125,'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the
380,1,10,0.442000,like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
380,1,10,0.778000,um
380,1,10,0.321722,they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um
380,1,10,0.479222,they have a certain uh they think that the
380,1,10,0.271613,like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
380,1,10,0.525167,complexity of character within the movie
380,1,10,0.650000,and um
380,1,10,0.390333,that somehow like
380,1,10,0.795500,<sigh> um
380,1,10,0.334636,what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
380,1,10,0.258000,it like xxx it's like the end of an era
380,1,10,0.324125,which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
380,1,10,0.295000,how they interact in the plot
380,1,10,0.761000,um
380,1,10,0.327000,kind of like
380,1,10,0.761000,uh
380,1,10,0.366667,yeah i guess
380,1,10,0.251481,i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
380,1,10,0.515500,the um
380,1,10,0.253889,i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
380,1,10,0.200231,i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
380,1,10,0.272000,in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
380,1,10,0.282394,um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
380,1,10,0.531000,um
380,1,10,0.372727,the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
380,1,10,0.231622,but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
380,1,10,0.218182,and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
380,1,10,0.232353,and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
380,1,10,0.340167,so in the movie django unchained
380,1,10,0.273483,um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
380,1,10,0.140000,the
380,1,10,0.268333,big purpose of the movie is
380,1,10,0.375500,and um
380,1,10,0.245556,and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
380,1,10,0.325294,who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
380,1,10,0.361905,was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
380,1,10,0.370769,or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
380,1,10,0.360500,and um
380,1,10,0.334500,and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
380,1,10,0.565800,sacrifice themself for someone else
380,1,10,0.346000,um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
380,1,10,0.520000,um
380,1,10,0.365000,like who
380,1,10,1.110000,uh like
380,1,10,0.209000,she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
380,1,10,0.302222,altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
380,1,10,0.320476,um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
380,1,10,0.226219,um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
380,1,10,0.317692,every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
380,1,10,0.341000,in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
380,1,10,0.286667,purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
380,1,10,0.801000,um
380,1,10,0.450500,and uh
380,1,10,0.360000,somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
380,1,10,0.392333,so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
380,1,10,0.250000,i think of losing my temper as being more
380,1,10,0.641000,um
380,1,10,0.183333,like i just
380,1,10,0.208571,so <s> i i would so <s>
380,1,10,0.557143,revert to um ad hominem like attacks
380,1,10,0.341111,uh but i i didn't like that's not um
380,1,10,0.285632,maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like
380,1,10,0.229500,well you're an idiot
380,1,10,0.284800,you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort
380,1,10,0.382000,yeah i'm glad you understand
380,1,10,0.590000,<deep breath>
380,1,10,0.309556,an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments
380,1,10,0.368000,not
380,1,10,0.989000,stories um
380,1,10,0.253571,like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so
380,1,10,0.338000,yeah
380,1,10,0.256000,the hardest decision i've ever had to make
380,1,10,0.574000,oh geez
380,1,10,0.240000,could it just be one of the hardest decisions
380,1,10,1.118000,hmm
380,1,10,0.922000,um
380,1,10,0.335000,like choosing between two things that it's like
380,1,10,0.280556,i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between
380,1,10,0.310000,two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life
380,1,10,0.241064,but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um
380,1,10,0.198750,and uh but i had to do it
380,1,10,0.323333,for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends
380,1,10,0.263333,were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world
380,1,10,0.216176,and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't
380,1,10,0.301739,i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think
380,1,10,0.221282,it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back
380,1,10,0.234444,to new york within like a month or two
380,1,10,0.221765,uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could
380,1,10,0.310000,leave new york
380,1,10,0.260000,it was how hard was that
380,1,10,0.232500,or how hard is
380,1,10,0.330000,how hard was that
380,1,10,1.000000,um
380,1,10,0.220000,it was hard
380,1,10,1.915000,<laughter> um
380,1,10,0.263846,it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like
380,1,10,0.430000,isolating isolating <is>
380,1,10,0.287000,'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends
380,1,10,0.620000,and uh
380,1,10,0.356667,that had kind of gone extremely
380,1,10,0.540000,badly
380,1,10,0.233333,and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole
380,1,10,0.272857,everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of
380,1,10,0.234444,saw it at the time so i didn't like
380,1,10,0.418571,you know just being socially isolated etcetera
380,1,10,0.310000,yeah
380,1,10,0.332000,well recently it's been awful
380,1,10,0.700000,um
380,1,10,0.410000,i uh
380,1,10,0.267059,i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours
380,1,10,0.275714,um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams
380,1,10,0.296000,but previous to that night
380,1,10,0.264167,so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep
380,1,10,0.218333,um because i was working on set and i would get back
380,1,10,0.286429,and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um
380,1,10,0.259091,too much riled up energy or something i i don't know
380,1,10,0.880000,tired uh
380,1,10,1.050000,very
380,1,10,0.282778,not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning
380,1,10,0.278250,and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so
380,1,10,0.740000,um
380,1,10,0.240000,i guess
380,1,10,0.346154,with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go
380,1,10,0.437500,um without caffeine it's
380,1,10,0.300000,i'm just i'm just quieter i guess
380,1,10,0.425000,more introverted
380,1,10,0.610000,since
380,1,10,0.264000,like lately as in when
380,1,10,1.030000,um
380,1,10,0.293333,change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like
380,1,10,0.233333,eh at the beginning where the
380,1,10,0.270256,the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends
380,1,10,0.556000,and the the push to
380,1,10,0.373684,to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um
380,1,10,0.284000,overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like
380,1,10,0.386667,coming to terms with that um
380,1,10,0.259259,and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just
380,1,10,0.180000,you know
380,1,10,0.438571,you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>
380,1,10,0.520000,no i just
380,1,10,0.470000,nope
380,1,10,0.301429,the last time i felt really happy
380,1,10,0.242000,might have to reach back
380,1,10,0.640000,um
380,1,10,0.271111,i think the last time i felt really happy
380,1,10,0.335714,was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie
380,1,10,0.880000,um co-wrote co-directed co-produced
380,1,10,0.780000,um
380,1,10,0.295500,and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the
380,1,10,0.358571,writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up
380,1,10,0.475000,eat breakfast
380,1,10,0.378000,bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative
380,1,10,0.300714,full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and
380,1,10,0.241458,and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like
380,1,10,0.370000,just like
380,1,10,0.204000,i felt like it yeah i guess that was the
380,1,10,0.211250,the last time that was that was like
380,1,10,0.233125,eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like
380,1,10,0.295714,you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't
380,1,10,0.261429,it's too much else to do so
380,1,10,0.225000,i would say that i'm very
380,1,10,0.310000,accepting <acce> like
380,1,10,0.377500,accepting of other people
380,1,10,0.454545,and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um
380,1,10,0.730000,and
380,1,10,0.260000,open <o> open <ope> like
380,1,10,0.384500,excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and
380,1,10,0.730000,yeah um
380,1,10,0.640000,hmm
380,1,10,0.750000,um
380,1,10,0.352500,i guess i wish i was less uh
380,1,10,0.930000,uh
380,1,10,0.404545,less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my
380,1,10,0.240000,you know
380,1,10,0.405000,everyday interactions and in my like
380,1,10,0.670000,um
380,1,10,0.205000,you know
380,1,10,0.437500,zest for for living
380,1,10,0.616000,um <sigh> yeah i xxx
380,1,10,0.271111,i other things i would change about myself i'd
380,1,10,0.220000,i would
380,1,10,0.527500,i don't know <laughter>
380,1,10,0.730000,hmm
380,1,10,0.425000,really badly about myself
380,1,10,0.700000,um
380,1,10,1.260000,<sigh>
380,1,10,0.298000,i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like
380,1,10,0.750000,uh
380,1,10,0.280667,like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um
380,1,10,0.400000,some sort of uh
380,1,10,0.355000,conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always
380,1,10,0.236667,always on the other side of the court you know like never
380,1,10,0.226000,it was i i noticed
380,1,10,0.329167,or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were
380,1,10,0.257857,like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with
380,1,10,0.271622,like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which
380,1,10,0.367778,um i was like blamed or like you know
380,1,10,0.416667,it was my it was my fault um when
380,1,10,0.231667,when what i was doing like
380,1,10,0.320000,yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like
380,1,10,0.266667,there's no yeah i don't know
380,1,10,0.410000,yeah
380,1,10,0.542500,ten years ago um
380,1,10,0.347273,stay stake you know like i i think that there's um
380,1,10,0.344000,i have a tendency to
380,1,10,0.236875,like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes
380,1,10,0.550000,um
380,1,10,0.295882,ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't
380,1,10,0.468000,don't decide that you um
380,1,10,0.512000,are only going to do
380,1,10,0.331714,one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums
380,1,10,0.268846,would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes
380,1,10,0.760000,um
380,1,10,0.225000,as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't
380,1,10,0.261818,it's only now that i um i don't know i guess
380,1,10,0.665000,stay uh
380,1,10,0.276000,don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie
380,1,10,0.280000,that's it
380,1,10,0.620000,sure
380,1,10,0.930000,goodbye
380,1,10,0.940000,bye
312,0,2,0.740000,yes
312,0,2,0.215000,fine how about you
312,0,2,0.270000,here
312,0,2,0.490000,yes
312,0,2,0.200000,the weather
312,0,2,0.320000,weather mainly
312,0,2,0.131667,yeah the main <ma> the weather
312,0,2,0.370000,sorry
312,0,2,0.286923,not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people
312,0,2,0.290000,okay i'm cutting you off
312,0,2,0.230000,not as much as i used to
312,0,2,0.203636,um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt
312,0,2,0.160000,i don't
312,0,2,0.227500,i don't enjoy traveling
312,0,2,0.311579,uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
312,0,2,0.292500,yes i am actually
312,0,2,0.226341,right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
312,0,2,0.440000,impressive
312,0,2,0.243077,professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that
312,0,2,0.201176,where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
312,0,2,0.233333,you're actually pretty good at this
312,0,2,0.274286,<sigh> i there's a lot of people
312,0,2,0.216364,the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
312,0,2,0.162500,he's the first one who taught me that
312,0,2,0.295556,school was not about a grade but about learning
312,0,2,0.370000,okay
312,0,2,0.352000,i'm pretty good i think
312,0,2,0.360000,i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about
312,0,2,0.177500,he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good
312,0,2,0.187500,um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all
312,0,2,0.530000,fairly close um
312,0,2,0.128000,i see them pretty 
312,0,2,0.242000,pretty often parents i see a couple times a week
312,0,2,0.206667,they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that
312,0,2,0.406667,and my brother i see 
312,0,2,0.294815,same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also
312,0,2,0.470000,interesting
312,0,2,0.470000,yes
312,0,2,0.363636,because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading
312,0,2,0.308571,and not talking to anybody that's introverted
312,0,2,0.205000,i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot
312,0,2,0.164000,i try to at least
312,0,2,0.245000,i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing
312,0,2,0.620000,um
312,0,2,0.555000,and that's about it i think
312,0,2,0.370000,<deep breath>
312,0,2,0.390000,bad parenting
312,0,2,0.337500,basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just 
312,0,2,0.155652,do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
312,0,2,0.460000,<sigh>
312,0,2,3.130000,um
312,0,2,0.840000,i guess
312,0,2,1.980000,scrubbed_entry
312,0,2,0.520000,um
312,0,2,6.180000,scrubbed_entry
312,0,2,12.660000,scrubbed_entry
312,0,2,0.155000,thank you
312,0,2,0.131429,i don't really have a best friend
312,0,2,0.385000,introverted remember
312,0,2,0.380000,i'm biased obviously
312,0,2,0.480000,but they are
312,0,2,0.204000,i'm really good in math
312,0,2,0.190000,i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is
312,0,2,0.178000,it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
312,0,2,0.234722,and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway
312,0,2,0.125000,that type of thing
312,0,2,0.360000,when i a good workout 
312,0,2,0.200000,doing well in video games small little things like that
312,0,2,0.490000,um
312,0,2,0.222353,what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
312,0,2,0.195000,thank you
312,0,2,0.265000,right now
312,0,2,0.237500,it's the fact that
312,0,2,0.307000,research that i did i did make it this far
312,0,2,0.262500,research wise that's all
312,0,2,0.140000,that's all
312,0,2,0.790000,interesting um
312,0,2,0.216667,when you start off in school
312,0,2,0.197353,you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
312,0,2,0.490000,and
312,0,2,0.185263,you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it
312,0,2,0.262143,and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you
312,0,2,0.201695,as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
312,0,2,0.350000,okay
312,0,2,1.020000,um
312,0,2,0.198462,a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class
312,0,2,0.205000,thank you
312,0,2,0.256667,yes briefly 
312,0,2,0.252000,many years ago <ag> yes
312,0,2,0.257429,i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that 
312,0,2,0.350909,um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen
312,0,2,0.251739,i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two
312,0,2,0.550000,yes
312,0,2,0.240000,not really
312,0,2,0.209375,i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much
312,0,2,0.305000,graduate school
312,0,2,0.375000,in physics
312,0,2,0.280000,no
312,0,2,0.360000,nope
312,0,2,0.235625,it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before
312,0,2,0.229474,if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard
312,0,2,0.265000,i guess moderately 
312,0,2,0.180000,thank you
312,0,2,0.440000,yes
312,0,2,0.250000,it's okay
312,0,2,0.168333,i'm probably like i am now
312,0,2,0.281579,normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function
312,0,2,0.230000,no
312,0,2,0.350000,maybe slightly
312,0,2,0.300000,sorry
312,0,2,0.270000,no
312,0,2,0.510000,yes
312,0,2,0.207143,yes i have changes in my thoughts
312,0,2,0.284483,um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that
312,0,2,0.146111,what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school
312,0,2,0.295000,i understand
312,0,2,0.440000,okay
312,0,2,0.240000,i agree
312,0,2,0.276667,no not really
312,0,2,0.238235,probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um
312,0,2,0.286429,twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen
312,0,2,0.187895,um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well
312,0,2,0.195385,even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally
312,0,2,0.245000,thank you
312,0,2,0.280000,same here
312,0,2,0.420000,goodbye
377,1,16,0.790000,<synch>
377,1,16,0.256667,yeah go ahead
377,1,16,0.416667,um i'm okay
377,1,16,0.275185,i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california
377,1,16,0.460000,mhm
377,1,16,0.331364,i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that
377,1,16,0.570000,um <sigh>
377,1,16,0.228571,at the most probably twice a year
377,1,16,0.434667,<laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter>
377,1,16,0.385000,um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um
377,1,16,0.770000,and
377,1,16,0.328182,i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so
377,1,16,0.435667,um yeah things were were changing
377,1,16,0.333125,in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial
377,1,16,0.390000,um
377,1,16,0.256774,main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so
377,1,16,0.125600,so i gave it a shot and here i am
377,1,16,0.504667,oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um
377,1,16,0.213437,i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but
377,1,16,0.313824,you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um
377,1,16,0.835000,and
377,1,16,0.383353,yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh
377,1,16,0.270000,yeah
377,1,16,0.280000,so
377,1,16,0.690000,<sigh>
377,1,16,0.633000,<laughter>
377,1,16,0.329722,i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um
377,1,16,0.269000,i was in morocco and i was in costa rica
377,1,16,0.318750,um i've spent some time in mexico so
377,1,16,0.440000,yeah
377,1,16,0.608846,um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also
377,1,16,0.350000,not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go
377,1,16,0.856667,um sure well
377,1,16,0.332000,i guess hmm
377,1,16,0.247136,i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but
377,1,16,0.336593,morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh
377,1,16,0.342727,yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun
377,1,16,0.397895,um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so
377,1,16,0.450455,my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was
377,1,16,0.279375,um being on a bus and and leaving
377,1,16,0.314500,um dublin and going just out to the countryside and
377,1,16,0.303871,seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but
377,1,16,0.300476,when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible
377,1,16,0.340000,yeah
377,1,16,0.316087,um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies
377,1,16,0.435000,no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so
377,1,16,0.260000,i actually do sales
377,1,16,0.448750,so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into
377,1,16,0.413750,comes into play and eh so does my
377,1,16,0.321711,i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach
377,1,16,1.310000,um
377,1,16,0.790000,to
377,1,16,0.305000,guess i'm not clear on the question um
377,1,16,0.350000,okay
377,1,16,0.400000,<laughter>
377,1,16,0.676667,wow um <sigh>
377,1,16,0.311667,you know my dream job is
377,1,16,0.655000,being a
377,1,16,0.390000,a motivational speaker and trainer and coach
377,1,16,0.339615,um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and
377,1,16,0.416000,um really contributing to people
377,1,16,0.395714,um my relationship's pretty good actually i
377,1,16,0.388182,i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would
377,1,16,0.343478,not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and
377,1,16,0.281562,um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother
377,1,16,0.358333,um last may and we've been
377,1,16,0.473571,we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so
377,1,16,0.960000,um
377,1,16,0.600000,<mutters>
377,1,16,0.441579,well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother
377,1,16,0.620000,um
377,1,16,0.244146,i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so
377,1,16,0.240000,yeah
377,1,16,0.330000,i'm shy
377,1,16,0.780000,<laughter>
377,1,16,0.840000,<laughter>
377,1,16,0.321207,um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance
377,1,16,0.417500,i love to read
377,1,16,0.287619,i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions
377,1,16,0.335455,that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else
377,1,16,0.470000,um
377,1,16,0.372857,i like to be with friends um
377,1,16,0.770000,i love art and
377,1,16,0.567500,trying new restaurants um
377,1,16,0.242000,yeah all those things are
377,1,16,0.310000,both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that
377,1,16,0.325556,um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so
377,1,16,0.665000,yeah yeah
377,1,16,0.337500,um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>
377,1,16,0.418462,um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be
377,1,16,0.245833,oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery
377,1,16,0.294286,yeah that was the last time so
377,1,16,0.412381,yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of
377,1,16,0.258000,uh it didn't show up
377,1,16,0.930000,and
377,1,16,0.353333,uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until
377,1,16,0.295000,um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and
377,1,16,0.214000,they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place
377,1,16,0.266333,so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that
377,1,16,0.310000,the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so
377,1,16,0.244231,i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated
377,1,16,0.300000,oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um
377,1,16,0.264000,let me think about one
377,1,16,0.253333,um the other day i had a phone call
377,1,16,0.425714,and i'm in a coaching program and
377,1,16,0.436364,it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program
377,1,16,0.291463,and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with
377,1,16,0.226765,and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with
377,1,16,0.470000,um
377,1,16,0.526875,someone who's not my coach and uh that
377,1,16,0.222321,hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these
377,1,16,0.266875,people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to
377,1,16,0.300385,not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know
377,1,16,0.340000,so
377,1,16,0.347500,yeah i wasn't um
377,1,16,0.317222,i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and
377,1,16,0.171875,it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but
377,1,16,0.380000,um
377,1,16,0.313333,yeah i could've
377,1,16,0.288333,certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and
377,1,16,0.171250,would've made the call go a lot smoother
377,1,16,0.338889,hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few
377,1,16,0.254000,i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision
377,1,16,0.371905,no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was
377,1,16,0.890000,challenging
377,1,16,0.340000,um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i
377,1,16,0.970000,moved
377,1,16,0.266842,uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado
377,1,16,0.276250,and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been
377,1,16,0.259167,you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know
377,1,16,0.298235,um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
377,1,16,0.534000,oh lots of things um
377,1,16,0.433000,i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and
377,1,16,0.407000,the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um
377,1,16,0.355500,at the time i was very much into rock climbing
377,1,16,0.423000,and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were
377,1,16,0.381538,um in my age group and or single that was another factor um
377,1,16,0.324684,and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit
377,1,16,0.550000,so
377,1,16,0.260000,yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but
377,1,16,0.313000,um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
377,1,16,0.310000,yeah
377,1,16,0.451250,uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>
377,1,16,0.673500,relatively easily
377,1,16,0.383826,it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then
377,1,16,0.307895,you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today
377,1,16,0.260833,but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty
377,1,16,0.468750,anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um
377,1,16,0.271852,but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily
377,1,16,0.320765,um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of
377,1,16,0.212381,out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um
377,1,16,0.262750,yeah and i just i have to find
377,1,16,0.238182,the financial means to support me in doing that and it's
377,1,16,0.405000,and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing
377,1,16,0.560000,so
377,1,16,0.320000,yeah
377,1,16,0.245936,um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation
377,1,16,0.406154,um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can
377,1,16,0.238949,there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do
377,1,16,0.368750,and mm my money's not working at all
377,1,16,0.341667,so yeah it feels pretty crappy
377,1,16,0.465000,<laughter> thanks
377,1,16,0.253333,i have in the past yeah
377,1,16,0.288333,oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago
377,1,16,0.260000,i was suicidal
377,1,16,0.275000,oh yeah i feel down mhm
377,1,16,0.340000,i don't actually no
377,1,16,0.690000,um
377,1,16,0.623750,well i originally stopped
377,1,16,0.302727,with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had
377,1,16,0.326429,worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed
377,1,16,0.546250,and um and then i began therapy again
377,1,16,0.525000,later on
377,1,16,0.183000,think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties
377,1,16,0.326923,um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so
377,1,16,0.263514,yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous
377,1,16,0.277344,i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see
377,1,16,0.775000,and
377,1,16,0.305455,you know work through that situation and come up with um
377,1,16,0.433333,a strategy for
377,1,16,0.363750,not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies
377,1,16,0.248947,and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever
377,1,16,0.448333,<deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow
377,1,16,0.500000,huh
377,1,16,0.242500,wow that's pretty sad
377,1,16,0.317500,um it was at least a year ago
377,1,16,0.361429,no i that's not true it was
377,1,16,0.360000,when i um
377,1,16,0.280000,saw my biological mother which was last may
377,1,16,0.550000,my best qualities

377,1,16,0.485000,very strong-willed
377,1,16,0.605000,i um

377,1,16,0.540000,um

377,1,16,0.495000,i'm intelligent
377,1,16,0.840000,and
377,1,16,1.080000,um
377,1,16,0.320000,yeah
377,1,16,0.333333,anything i regret
377,1,16,0.335000,i don't think so
377,1,16,0.340000,no
377,1,16,0.366667,<sigh> don't take life too seriously
377,1,16,1.790000,<laughter>

388,1,17,0.360000,bye
487,0,0,0.850000,<synch>
487,0,0,0.500000,yes
487,0,0,0.272500,i'm fine thank you
487,0,0,0.715000,detroit michigan
487,0,0,0.540000,yes
487,0,0,0.330000,i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here
487,0,0,0.307778,many more years ago more like forty years ago
487,0,0,0.361250,uh i don't go back to detroit anymore
487,0,0,0.314091,i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here
487,0,0,0.366667,in california and
487,0,0,0.635000,uh completely different um
487,0,0,0.416000,for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't
487,0,0,0.336364,the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space
487,0,0,0.452000,a warmer climate warmer people
487,0,0,0.406667,just a different
487,0,0,0.480000,different uh vibe
487,0,0,0.200000,that i that i like better
487,0,0,0.287895,after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier
487,0,0,0.270769,to start over here than some of the other places i had lived
487,0,0,0.202857,or to stay where we were at
487,0,0,0.262273,extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it
487,0,0,0.240000,plus i had also
487,0,0,0.327692,taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here
487,0,0,0.192308,and went to school out here so i was completely used to it
487,0,0,0.278333,well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh
487,0,0,0.456250,less crowded it's more open space it's a
487,0,0,0.667500,a calmer friendlier vibe
487,0,0,0.480000,less rushed
487,0,0,0.296000,the smog would be one
487,0,0,0.446667,and when i drive the traffic
487,0,0,0.355714,in certain areas it can be but
487,0,0,0.580000,um
487,0,0,0.380000,in general
487,0,0,0.245000,there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's
487,0,0,0.310909,isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens
487,0,0,0.359286,the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like
487,0,0,0.235000,i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all
487,0,0,0.350000,so
487,0,0,0.213333,i don't travel as much as i used to
487,0,0,0.480000,but i have traveled worldwide
487,0,0,0.720000,new experiences
487,0,0,0.263571,well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled
487,0,0,0.322000,through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so
487,0,0,0.282500,i've traveled a lot of different places and
487,0,0,0.188571,um i'll have to say they were
487,0,0,0.349375,all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn
487,0,0,0.690000,enjoy experience
487,0,0,0.342500,uh my experiences i would say in um
487,0,0,0.540000,europe visiting moreso i've also visited
487,0,0,0.272143,uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different
487,0,0,0.376667,i would probably say more shy um in general
487,0,0,0.343636,um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing
487,0,0,0.590000,although
487,0,0,0.282857,i've had them describe me as outgoing
487,0,0,0.320769,i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike
487,0,0,0.356000,listen to music you know
487,0,0,0.300000,i'm very good at controlling my temper
487,0,0,0.600000,oh
487,0,0,0.317500,probably when i was
487,0,0,0.294286,married with my husband many years ago
487,0,0,0.289286,it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him
487,0,0,0.245556,it could be it could be a choice of
487,0,0,0.750000,uh
487,0,0,0.278333,some of the instances when i might've been with him and i
487,0,0,0.328000,you know got emotional or
487,0,0,0.274000,let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than
487,0,0,0.540000,um
487,0,0,0.406667,just you know seen it as
487,0,0,0.344211,not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so
487,0,0,0.294400,you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate
487,0,0,0.263333,but some people
487,0,0,0.281250,you know don't respond to the so-called norm
487,0,0,0.177500,if you ignore it
487,0,0,0.264615,mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case
487,0,0,0.342000,i taught middle school kids and you can try calm
487,0,0,0.267222,um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain
487,0,0,0.418889,you know your professional demeanor so you can't really
487,0,0,0.289500,um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so
487,0,0,0.372500,well that could be
487,0,0,0.810000,several
487,0,0,0.380000,mm
487,0,0,0.331429,um i guess a decision in um
487,0,0,0.315455,along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery
487,0,0,0.690000,uh
487,0,0,0.315833,that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way
487,0,0,0.404286,and in that case she died so
487,0,0,0.220000,you know
487,0,0,0.233478,uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious
487,0,0,0.278000,outcome for them as well
487,0,0,0.530000,mhm
487,0,0,0.304706,<sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing
487,0,0,0.237143,things that you might could do but
487,0,0,0.275714,they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to
487,0,0,0.336000,erase them you know if
487,0,0,0.260000,you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a
487,0,0,0.258889,strong reaction and they don't really look past the
487,0,0,0.362000,uh impact of the event
487,0,0,0.270000,'cause there might be something that
487,0,0,0.226000,you can gain from that
487,0,0,0.225455,but there are i i grew up in a home of
487,0,0,0.437500,dysfunction so there was
487,0,0,0.470000,just domestic abuse you know and um
487,0,0,0.286111,there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things
487,0,0,0.265556,but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things
487,0,0,0.300000,that occur in life as an adult that
487,0,0,0.421250,sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that
487,0,0,0.470000,have not had really strong experiences
487,0,0,0.263333,fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
487,0,0,0.247200,um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can
487,0,0,0.413333,walk them through
487,0,0,0.475000,levels of
487,0,0,0.552500,understanding and you know
487,0,0,0.372500,as you know someone
487,0,0,0.431250,you have a balance of background information on
487,0,0,0.267857,which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will
487,0,0,0.350000,progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like
487,0,0,0.274000,the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be
487,0,0,0.363333,and you can also relate other experiences to them
487,0,0,0.371667,of things that were worse or
487,0,0,0.214000,you know seem to be
487,0,0,0.231111,and of course there's always in general i mean
487,0,0,0.221000,when you look at all the calamities in the world
487,0,0,0.460000,you know most of those things aren't affecting
487,0,0,0.237500,us or the people that we know here
487,0,0,0.456667,so that provides
487,0,0,0.433333,us perspective that
487,0,0,0.268750,you know can pull someone out of their
487,0,0,0.411250,i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly
487,0,0,0.366250,intensity of their experience right at the moment
487,0,0,0.415000,well we have a a good relationship they
487,0,0,0.288000,eh for the most part there are different levels of
487,0,0,0.380714,um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has
487,0,0,0.385385,made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others
487,0,0,0.374000,some have not had um
487,0,0,0.395000,as much
487,0,0,0.292500,experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way
487,0,0,0.405000,so it's always evolving
487,0,0,0.500000,and i
487,0,0,0.386250,walk in positivity as a a lead of
487,0,0,0.359167,you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender
487,0,0,0.383333,a more positive
487,0,0,0.553333,response from them
487,0,0,0.576667,rather than feed
487,0,0,0.575000,sometimes the
487,0,0,0.392500,um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have
487,0,0,0.350000,pardon
487,0,0,0.140000,i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat
487,0,0,0.560000,hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends
487,0,0,0.267778,well my mother has always been a very calm
487,0,0,0.325000,um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of
487,0,0,0.472500,negativity i've had teachers that have um been
487,0,0,0.550000,very um
487,0,0,0.348000,positive <po> positive and proactive
487,0,0,0.395000,and have you know taught independent thinking and
487,0,0,0.338889,techniques to rise above some of the things that
487,0,0,0.385000,were occurring
487,0,0,0.286364,and just various friends that you know i would see handling
487,0,0,0.443846,situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so
487,0,0,0.259091,it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good
487,0,0,0.310000,um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or
487,0,0,0.373333,you know um
487,0,0,0.259524,trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but
487,0,0,0.460000,um
487,0,0,0.295000,in general i don't have a problem sleeping
487,0,0,0.288000,it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done
487,0,0,0.288846,i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so
487,0,0,0.382000,um but in general good
487,0,0,0.900000,like
487,0,0,0.210000,i mean
487,0,0,0.393333,not in particular
487,0,0,0.190000,i mean i just seems
487,0,0,0.450000,um
487,0,0,0.281667,less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do
487,0,0,0.281429,in a shorter period of time but
487,0,0,0.516667,you know reorganizing
487,0,0,0.323333,some of the
487,0,0,0.215000,things that need to be done
487,0,0,0.338333,you know can smoothe that out
487,0,0,0.277778,no i haven't but i know it's something that
487,0,0,0.348182,a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have
487,0,0,0.312500,i have not no
487,0,0,0.406667,well there's several i guess um
487,0,0,0.297500,and happiness comes in
487,0,0,0.256296,small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning
487,0,0,0.255000,is great
487,0,0,0.660000,wonderful
487,0,0,0.330000,you know day of happiness um
487,0,0,0.290000,as far as big
487,0,0,0.347826,celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum
487,0,0,0.245000,you know
487,0,0,0.220000,in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be
487,0,0,0.325000,you know a moment shared with someone you know so
487,0,0,0.302222,it should be an even on an even keel
487,0,0,0.580000,um
487,0,0,0.646667,as uh uh
487,0,0,1.020000,perseverant
487,0,0,0.278000,um you know i will
487,0,0,0.436667,continue forth and
487,0,0,0.630000,and um
487,0,0,0.740000,positive
487,0,0,0.480000,upbeat
487,0,0,1.160000,um
487,0,0,0.440000,maybe not doing
487,0,0,0.329167,things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or
487,0,0,0.470000,or spending my
487,0,0,0.343750,time you know a little more differently but
487,0,0,0.210714,that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see
487,0,0,0.262500,you know you could've done some things differently
487,0,0,0.320000,instead of buying
487,0,0,0.239474,the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that
487,0,0,0.535000,i would have um
487,0,0,0.416250,made myself move to california sooner and i'm
487,0,0,0.315000,i would have um
487,0,0,0.227333,instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss>
487,0,0,0.225556,would have you know the situation i have now
487,0,0,0.291818,waited to get something different but you know how can you
487,0,0,0.232500,you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time
487,0,0,0.412857,with the best information <in> information available
487,0,0,0.258889,you know after you have looked at several options
487,0,0,0.485000,of um
487,0,0,0.800000,being
487,0,0,0.570000,independent and educated able to
487,0,0,0.264000,uh take care of myself
487,0,0,0.440000,okay
487,0,0,0.196667,bye bye now
352,1,10,0.235000,yes 
352,1,10,0.333333,i'm doing pretty good <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.295000,i'm from oklahoma

352,1,10,0.288966,um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.296333,um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean  
352,1,10,0.325000,i studied psychology and minored in art 
352,1,10,0.288571,um no not at the moment 
352,1,10,0.284167,um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law 
352,1,10,0.430000,my dream job oh 
352,1,10,0.332500,i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um
352,1,10,0.245909,i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter>
352,1,10,0.340000,to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends 
352,1,10,0.406667,things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people
352,1,10,0.476957,um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.500000,when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but
352,1,10,0.332500,i try to just
352,1,10,0.281944,like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything 
352,1,10,0.590000,um
352,1,10,0.296071,it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like
352,1,10,0.242593,like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it 
352,1,10,0.259000,<sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone
352,1,10,0.390000,it was probably with my parents um
352,1,10,0.390000,i've been having some some car trouble lately and
352,1,10,0.251923,i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that
352,1,10,0.344762,i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues 
352,1,10,0.222174,i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time 
352,1,10,0.575000,oh definitely i mean
352,1,10,0.361765,my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just 
352,1,10,0.261111,she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways 
352,1,10,0.760000,oh
352,1,10,0.388462,probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda
352,1,10,0.307429,um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>
352,1,10,0.268286,yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go
352,1,10,0.241905,travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool 
352,1,10,0.333158,uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um
352,1,10,0.263846,because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's
352,1,10,0.242647,all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the
352,1,10,0.237143,diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool 
352,1,10,0.179000,no i have not served in the military <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.390000,nope
352,1,10,0.316333,no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've
352,1,10,0.284444,i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  
352,1,10,0.315000,lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep
352,1,10,0.302286,or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  
352,1,10,0.311944,i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function 
352,1,10,0.327143,i've been feeling really good um 
352,1,10,0.372143,over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and
352,1,10,0.355185,that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through
352,1,10,0.238039,a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and
352,1,10,0.234118,so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>
352,1,10,0.263810,um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more 
352,1,10,0.250312,positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and
352,1,10,0.228571,of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to
352,1,10,0.230000,kind of
352,1,10,0.240556,just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more
352,1,10,0.294545,confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   
352,1,10,0.308571,oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um 
352,1,10,0.270000,i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and
352,1,10,0.274815,it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and
352,1,10,0.246364,um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just
352,1,10,0.202059,like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.388182,my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and
352,1,10,0.522500,bold and fearless um
352,1,10,0.420000,that i'm unique
352,1,10,0.795000,and artistic
352,1,10,0.288605,and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.335000,um 
352,1,10,0.550000,probably
352,1,10,0.480000,just like
352,1,10,0.340435,the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very
352,1,10,0.257826,exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and
352,1,10,0.245778,i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and
352,1,10,0.256304,i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
352,1,10,0.354000,oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so
352,1,10,0.286667,i wouldn't really change anything 
352,1,10,0.545000,oh <sigh>
352,1,10,0.247333,i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i 
352,1,10,0.352381,should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because
352,1,10,0.420000,um
352,1,10,0.231463,i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just
352,1,10,0.227368,tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
352,1,10,0.360000,oh 
352,1,10,0.351250,let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> 
352,1,10,0.547500,um oh i guess
352,1,10,0.290857,i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since
352,1,10,0.376667,i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so
352,1,10,0.199706,um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun 
352,1,10,0.360000,cool
352,1,10,0.170000,you're welcome 
352,1,10,0.190000,bye 
328,0,4,0.440000,yes
328,0,4,0.185000,<laughter> 
328,0,4,0.212500,fine how are you
328,0,4,0.226364,uh watts california but now i live in west l_a 
328,0,4,0.445000,<laughter> yes
328,0,4,0.289615,i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city  
328,0,4,0.410000,the traffic it's terrible 
328,0,4,0.264000,i studied child development 
328,0,4,0.316667,yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations 
328,0,4,0.247391,oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies 
328,0,4,0.307547,well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film
328,0,4,0.280000,<laughter> 
328,0,4,0.272000,last time i made a film just this last october made a short film 
328,0,4,0.425000,<laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally
328,0,4,0.340000,thanks <laughter> 
328,0,4,0.390000,really mad uh 
328,0,4,0.597500,<laughter> really mad i
328,0,4,0.289808,you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad 
328,0,4,0.160000,yeah 
328,0,4,0.274000,<laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school 
328,0,4,0.300714,no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that
328,0,4,0.353077,you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you
328,0,4,0.331333,you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um
328,0,4,0.223750,other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  
328,0,4,0.485000,<sigh> 
328,0,4,0.302500,the hardest thing about being a parent 
328,0,4,0.457500,i would say is
328,0,4,0.503333,trying to give
328,0,4,0.296190,that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so
328,0,4,0.226000,it gets very uh 
328,0,4,0.340000,um
328,0,4,0.262258,annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt
328,0,4,0.233611,it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   
328,0,4,0.630000,mm
328,0,4,0.247600,yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch
328,0,4,0.325172,but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it
328,0,4,0.216000,you as a parent you're happy they got it 
328,0,4,0.266923,<sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they 
328,0,4,0.213500,yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs
328,0,4,0.245000,she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
328,0,4,0.295789,you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for
328,0,4,0.350000,having the children tell you that you're a good person so
328,0,4,0.150000,i like that 
328,0,4,0.350000,hmm
328,0,4,0.546000,oh <laughter> my god they're
328,0,4,0.404211,ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity
328,0,4,0.299500,and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but
328,0,4,0.439600,they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or
328,0,4,0.229048,you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information
328,0,4,0.339000,and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed
328,0,4,0.246000,and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong
328,0,4,0.240000,hmm
328,0,4,0.308095,me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation 
328,0,4,0.360000,argued 
328,0,4,0.417273,i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about
328,0,4,0.315000,gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember 
328,0,4,0.313333,it was petty
328,0,4,0.271667,yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it
328,0,4,0.180000,hmm
328,0,4,0.350000,my fiancee
328,0,4,0.453571,<laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at

328,0,4,0.228286,i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him  
328,0,4,0.307000,advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago
328,0,4,0.310566,i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more 
328,0,4,0.510000,really happy 
328,0,4,0.960000,hmm
328,0,4,0.350000,really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house

328,0,4,0.376957,shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights

370,0,0,0.920000,<synch>
370,0,0,0.230000,yeah
370,0,0,0.282000,i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you
370,0,0,0.263571,uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley
370,0,0,0.330000,yeah
370,0,0,0.308182,uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um
370,0,0,0.254211,the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um
370,0,0,0.385455,camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like
370,0,0,0.225172,eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that
370,0,0,0.155000,that i i i would say i like that too
370,0,0,0.236800,<laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath>
370,0,0,0.341818,uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um
370,0,0,0.231875,and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know
370,0,0,0.226190,that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but
370,0,0,0.265000,that's fine
370,0,0,0.340833,wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter>
370,0,0,0.403333,i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow
370,0,0,0.255882,make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but
370,0,0,0.220556,that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if
370,0,0,0.257391,if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things
370,0,0,0.183571,and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
370,0,0,0.265814,well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be
370,0,0,0.345333,eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um
370,0,0,0.241364,i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also
370,0,0,0.239630,fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um
370,0,0,0.174762,so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great
370,0,0,0.296667,uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last
370,0,0,0.490000,trip i i
370,0,0,0.525000,took um
370,0,0,0.301818,lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um
370,0,0,0.220000,well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um
370,0,0,0.210000,austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age
370,0,0,0.285000,so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um
370,0,0,0.370000,like
370,0,0,0.219474,tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life
370,0,0,0.338889,i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and
370,0,0,0.192381,so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my
370,0,0,0.253929,my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to
370,0,0,0.251200,traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and
370,0,0,0.229000,it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
370,0,0,0.283250,uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so
370,0,0,0.227500,i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like
370,0,0,0.324667,familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um
370,0,0,0.235217,maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh
370,0,0,0.287407,like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that
370,0,0,0.288571,uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really
370,0,0,0.228889,relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and
370,0,0,0.225000,i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax
370,0,0,0.236829,i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so
370,0,0,0.263077,i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um
370,0,0,0.208696,yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't
370,0,0,0.160000,i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all
370,0,0,0.433000,the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>
370,0,0,0.332857,i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about
370,0,0,0.252069,things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict
370,0,0,0.252500,as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um
370,0,0,0.234500,really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't
370,0,0,0.142308,sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing
370,0,0,0.336818,something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um
370,0,0,0.216667,i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um
370,0,0,0.258182,i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not
370,0,0,0.253043,even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or
370,0,0,0.219429,running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait
370,0,0,0.258696,waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
370,0,0,0.903333,um <sigh> hmm
370,0,0,0.477143,um nothing immediately comes to mind i
370,0,0,0.206500,well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh
370,0,0,0.415000,was um
370,0,0,0.222885,driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow
370,0,0,0.231212,rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like
370,0,0,0.245581,reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but
370,0,0,0.224865,it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they
370,0,0,0.305263,you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um
370,0,0,0.236667,<deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened
370,0,0,0.233889,it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck
370,0,0,0.335250,well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh
370,0,0,0.208095,i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up
370,0,0,0.338750,'til one or two every night uh and
370,0,0,0.227727,it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were
370,0,0,0.475000,more um
370,0,0,0.205385,able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven
370,0,0,0.334167,and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to
370,0,0,0.197500,going to sleep later and waking up later
370,0,0,0.274091,i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um
370,0,0,0.273846,you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh
370,0,0,0.287778,um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that
370,0,0,0.284375,no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um
370,0,0,0.322759,everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening
370,0,0,0.320000,no
370,0,0,0.420000,no
370,0,0,0.293158,well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh>
370,0,0,0.266667,in my life uh yeah like i said i
370,0,0,0.241176,i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i
370,0,0,0.204500,there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh
370,0,0,0.194839,i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we
370,0,0,0.199412,we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life
370,0,0,0.361667,i would say that um <sigh>
370,0,0,0.583333,it's important to
370,0,0,0.213333,to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um
370,0,0,0.261852,recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from
370,0,0,0.297500,the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um
370,0,0,0.188462,kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which
370,0,0,0.240526,eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um
370,0,0,0.350000,that approach it's kinda fatalistic
370,0,0,0.190526,and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that
370,0,0,0.182143,it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of
370,0,0,0.264615,you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place
370,0,0,1.065000,um <sigh>
370,0,0,0.730000,well i <sigh>
370,0,0,0.309000,i i guess when people i i don't especially um
370,0,0,0.267143,take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that
370,0,0,0.289643,so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is
370,0,0,0.395714,uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized
370,0,0,0.177895,i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
370,0,0,0.199074,uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody
370,0,0,0.347500,just out of uh college you know um
370,0,0,0.354286,went over what we had done and
370,0,0,0.252069,you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and
370,0,0,0.241304,i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
370,0,0,0.246250,it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
370,0,0,0.287083,i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh
370,0,0,0.268462,not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of
370,0,0,0.213514,you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that
370,0,0,0.236129,the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but
370,0,0,0.315714,you know it wasn't our call <sigh>
370,0,0,0.568000,mm most memorable experiences um
370,0,0,0.198750,well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um
370,0,0,0.293214,the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um
370,0,0,0.307333,for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest
370,0,0,0.189200,period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i
370,0,0,0.213000,i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um
370,0,0,0.232045,and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun
370,0,0,0.254643,uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we
370,0,0,0.248947,we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty
370,0,0,0.241316,happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been
370,0,0,0.243043,very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so
370,0,0,0.200000,yeah
370,0,0,0.247500,yeah thank you <laughter>
370,0,0,0.425000,uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um
370,0,0,0.336154,sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh
370,0,0,0.410000,you know um
370,0,0,0.676667,helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh>
370,0,0,0.360000,intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh
370,0,0,0.500000,i
370,0,0,0.288333,what else i think that um my best friend might say that
370,0,0,0.252581,uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i
370,0,0,0.444167,also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans
370,0,0,0.400000,mm
370,0,0,0.309231,uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um
370,0,0,0.365000,hmm <tisk>
370,0,0,0.217193,well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that
370,0,0,0.233226,um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um
370,0,0,0.244167,my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh
370,0,0,0.250000,i'd say maybe the fact that
370,0,0,0.218000,it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that
370,0,0,0.220000,no problem have a good day thank you
370,0,0,0.490000,goodbye
449,0,2,0.820000,<synch>
449,0,2,0.355000,okay
449,0,2,0.226667,yes i am
449,0,2,0.280000,i'm good thank you
449,0,2,0.310000,<laughter>
449,0,2,0.295455,originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america
449,0,2,0.370000,yes
449,0,2,0.244857,the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to
449,0,2,0.491111,traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um
449,0,2,0.195000,um that's about it
449,0,2,0.320000,<laughter>
449,0,2,0.184500,when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to
449,0,2,0.284545,go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean
449,0,2,0.205745,the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>
449,0,2,0.295833,um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from
449,0,2,0.166786,so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home
449,0,2,0.222143,so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom
449,0,2,0.218750,and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
449,0,2,0.585000,experiences on vacation or
449,0,2,0.635000,um most memorable experience
449,0,2,0.271429,probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so
449,0,2,0.237368,having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause
449,0,2,0.172353,no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>
449,0,2,0.257857,business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field
449,0,2,0.249286,so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
449,0,2,0.326667,my dream job
449,0,2,0.530000,hmm
449,0,2,0.169286,well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook
449,0,2,0.228696,and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family
449,0,2,0.190227,if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now
449,0,2,0.216364,but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
449,0,2,0.360000,i'm outgoing
449,0,2,0.760000,<laughter>
449,0,2,0.415000,<laughter> that's cool <laughter>
449,0,2,0.203243,uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at
449,0,2,0.229375,and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e
449,0,2,0.279167,so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation
449,0,2,0.235625,figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
449,0,2,0.273636,i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with
449,0,2,0.312500,um i don't really let anything agitate me
449,0,2,0.170400,and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just
449,0,2,0.192593,do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it
449,0,2,0.212500,be who you are and just stay there
449,0,2,0.248250,actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it
449,0,2,0.221250,and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways
449,0,2,0.187826,and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
449,0,2,0.293636,when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because
449,0,2,0.243902,the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
449,0,2,0.210455,and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
449,0,2,0.537500,hmm <sigh> let's see
449,0,2,0.223333,i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old
449,0,2,0.272353,and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it
449,0,2,0.220645,he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him
449,0,2,0.203750,as opposed to waiting him to call me
449,0,2,0.163333,and i think
449,0,2,0.227250,it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come
449,0,2,0.140000,and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place
449,0,2,0.216757,but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but
449,0,2,0.273281,i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult
449,0,2,0.216364,and then also not expected him to just kinda you know
449,0,2,0.241765,i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
449,0,2,0.274516,woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and
449,0,2,0.235200,i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so
449,0,2,0.243077,it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally
449,0,2,0.560000,so
449,0,2,0.268929,my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect
449,0,2,0.257727,so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
449,0,2,0.246452,seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change
449,0,2,0.320714,but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just
449,0,2,0.202353,kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that
449,0,2,0.204697,i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own
449,0,2,0.227059,and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but
449,0,2,0.248750,whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
449,0,2,0.262727,it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real
449,0,2,0.204375,it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy
449,0,2,0.246000,um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own
449,0,2,0.247895,and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just
449,0,2,0.269524,being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
449,0,2,0.283182,wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here
449,0,2,0.256364,so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing
449,0,2,0.233333,it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure
449,0,2,0.221538,uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling
449,0,2,0.205161,but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter
449,0,2,0.201667,so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
449,0,2,0.233667,divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me
449,0,2,0.210909,and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore
449,0,2,0.490000,and
449,0,2,0.236170,since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while
449,0,2,0.211818,um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just
449,0,2,0.205385,did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of
449,0,2,0.218667,how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything
449,0,2,0.284545,physical and and all the material stuff i could care less
449,0,2,0.179583,but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
449,0,2,0.254000,uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that
449,0,2,0.228140,he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it
449,0,2,0.225556,bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home
449,0,2,0.275854,and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through
449,0,2,0.194600,and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself
449,0,2,0.192857,in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
449,0,2,0.380000,<laughter>
449,0,2,0.249730,you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day
449,0,2,0.205000,my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night
449,0,2,0.225909,i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody
449,0,2,0.225000,did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma
449,0,2,0.187500,i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today
449,0,2,0.189048,and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to
449,0,2,0.205714,go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
449,0,2,0.291500,really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son
449,0,2,0.279891,my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance
449,0,2,0.290000,but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle
449,0,2,0.231875,that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little
449,0,2,0.308750,mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
449,0,2,0.330000,<laughter>
449,0,2,0.276000,no i haven't thank god
449,0,2,0.260000,no
449,0,2,0.417500,really happy let's see
449,0,2,0.257000,uh it's at home and i think it was when
449,0,2,0.310000,wow
449,0,2,0.318750,<mumbling> different things running through my head um
449,0,2,0.219474,i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on
449,0,2,0.216364,our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me
449,0,2,0.162727,and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me
449,0,2,0.297273,without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself
449,0,2,0.178421,and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very
449,0,2,0.235600,tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
449,0,2,0.290000,<laughter>
449,0,2,0.250000,thank you
449,0,2,0.536667,um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very
449,0,2,0.287059,you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be
449,0,2,0.230698,um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do
449,0,2,0.251429,and i just you know i don't
449,0,2,0.271429,i don't deal with b s <laughter>
449,0,2,0.311429,hmm what could i change about myself
449,0,2,0.268519,uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself
449,0,2,0.284615,um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um
449,0,2,0.173333,i think i would just be
449,0,2,0.196800,a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware
449,0,2,0.212245,make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody
449,0,2,0.206333,i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me
449,0,2,0.187619,so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret
449,0,2,0.207600,because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that
449,0,2,0.282273,everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it
449,0,2,0.206786,what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
449,0,2,0.500000,hmm
449,0,2,0.241000,be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am
449,0,2,0.260667,to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure
449,0,2,0.220667,be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me
449,0,2,0.270000,don't try to revamp <re>
449,0,2,0.215385,don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not
449,0,2,0.240526,uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders
449,0,2,0.221667,but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it
449,0,2,0.223333,but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments
449,0,2,0.275862,my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what
449,0,2,0.239375,at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle
449,0,2,0.235714,that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary
449,0,2,5.330000,scrubbed_entry
449,0,2,0.292500,and i'm always just
449,0,2,0.180294,true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that
449,0,2,0.252500,i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from
449,0,2,0.210000,<laughter>

346,1,23,0.266667,it isn't 
346,1,23,0.218750,um i tend to think a lot 
346,1,23,0.201111,um about the things that stress me out 
346,1,23,0.225714,um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um

346,1,23,0.193750,because of stuff that've happened to me 
346,1,23,0.240000,so um 
346,1,23,0.240714,i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well

346,1,23,0.233125,i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um 
346,1,23,0.371667,just to keep myself involved 
346,1,23,0.274324,um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can 
346,1,23,0.291000,um by running around and and and doing things 
346,1,23,0.180000,so 
346,1,23,0.400000,um it's difficult 
346,1,23,0.200000,um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna 
346,1,23,0.266400,i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh 
346,1,23,0.279091,i make appointments to like for auditions or or um 
346,1,23,0.302500,even to do this i um i i tend to uh 
346,1,23,0.200000,just not 
346,1,23,0.211250,like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  
346,1,23,0.205000,yes 
346,1,23,0.343750,um i've been diagnosed for two instances 
346,1,23,0.250000,um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago 
346,1,23,0.385556,and then i was diagnosed again um in august
346,1,23,0.305000,um 
346,1,23,0.224286,the first time it was um 
346,1,23,0.247692,i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  
346,1,23,0.333636,and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress 
346,1,23,0.225000,um 
346,1,23,0.275278,and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um 
346,1,23,0.246364,and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore 
346,1,23,0.260000,so i i figured um 
346,1,23,0.210909,i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um 
346,1,23,0.340000,not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated 
346,1,23,0.175000,yeah 
346,1,23,0.146667,it was 
346,1,23,0.168000,i no <n> do not
346,1,23,0.213125,um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um 
346,1,23,0.215000,get out of my environment 
346,1,23,0.460000,um
346,1,23,0.340000,and uh 
346,1,23,0.155000,and that seemed to help a lot 
346,1,23,0.225000,um 
346,1,23,0.249615,and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much 
346,1,23,0.160000,um they just 
346,1,23,0.180000,they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed 
346,1,23,0.140000,um 
346,1,23,0.442500,yeah so um 
346,1,23,0.110000,yeah 
346,1,23,0.348125,<sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  
346,1,23,0.370000,um 
346,1,23,0.185714,but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  
346,1,23,0.322500,keeping myself busy 
346,1,23,0.350000,um 
346,1,23,0.363333,actually um 
346,1,23,0.216667,i'm kind of
346,1,23,0.218000,a couple days ago 
346,1,23,0.222500,i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  
346,1,23,0.228750,um but then i went back to 
346,1,23,0.323333,being you know going back to feeling miserable 
346,1,23,0.470000,so
346,1,23,0.400000,um 
346,1,23,0.317500,well i realized 
346,1,23,0.145625,i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep 
346,1,23,0.296667,and um 
346,1,23,0.275556,i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky 
346,1,23,0.277500,um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me 
346,1,23,0.270000,and uh 
346,1,23,0.263889,you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that 
346,1,23,0.208571,and that made me really happy 
346,1,23,0.245000,um 
346,1,23,0.190000,yeah 
346,1,23,0.196667,thank you <laughter>
346,1,23,0.485000,oh geez
346,1,23,0.400000,um 
346,1,23,0.276250,i've had so many years of just 
346,1,23,0.253750,just bad just a lot of bad 
346,1,23,0.277000,that it there has it's been a long time 
346,1,23,0.261429,since i've been proud of anything 
346,1,23,0.348235,i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through 
346,1,23,0.273000,um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've 
346,1,23,0.212222,gotten rid of themselves a long time ago 
346,1,23,0.245769,but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um 
346,1,23,0.174286,there's gotta be a silver lining 
346,1,23,0.270000,so 
346,1,23,0.270588,um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh 
346,1,23,0.226944,i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people 
346,1,23,0.313333,and um 
346,1,23,0.220833,and truthful and i still i still have drive in me 
346,1,23,0.225000,yeah 
346,1,23,0.423333,ugh <sigh> so much um 
346,1,23,0.350000,my last marriage
346,1,23,0.264444,um not getting out when i should have 
346,1,23,0.305000,um 
346,1,23,0.410000,and uh just
346,1,23,0.210000,i regret a lot
346,1,23,0.650000,<sigh>
346,1,23,0.295833,um the any situation that would've had a red flag um 
346,1,23,0.287143,eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work
346,1,23,0.250000,and um 
346,1,23,0.212941,no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um 
346,1,23,0.306667,i i would tell myself um to um 
346,1,23,0.284000,that it's not selfish 
346,1,23,0.223750,to let go of a bad situation 
346,1,23,0.298947,and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself 
346,1,23,0.175000,so if
346,1,23,0.211000,had i known that then had had i known that
346,1,23,0.251000,then i i i probably would've done better in life
346,1,23,0.180000,so 
346,1,23,0.205000,yeah 
346,1,23,0.550000,<sigh>
346,1,23,0.630000,um
346,1,23,0.262500,people who um 
346,1,23,0.237000,when people are down on me for my faults 
346,1,23,0.288929,um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um 
346,1,23,0.377143,people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy
346,1,23,0.660000,um
346,1,23,0.265556,just anybody who picks on the little guy 
346,1,23,0.295000,um 
346,1,23,0.365455,you know people who don't care about the environment or animals
346,1,23,0.255000,um 
346,1,23,0.182941,i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be 
346,1,23,0.288974,and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do 
346,1,23,0.200000,and uh i that makes me mad 
346,1,23,0.510000,<laughter> i vent <laughter> um 
346,1,23,0.247778,yeah i tend to vent and then uh 
346,1,23,0.272500,and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um
346,1,23,0.283158,i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore
346,1,23,0.560000,mm
346,1,23,0.356250,i try not to get angry um 
346,1,23,0.312857,because i have a really bad temper
346,1,23,0.227500,and it um 
346,1,23,0.277778,and it can get outta hand so um 
346,1,23,0.179500,what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap
346,1,23,0.229412, um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind
346,1,23,0.151667,and come back to it 
346,1,23,0.310000,um 
346,1,23,0.229286,it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um 
346,1,23,0.246000,it was about um 
346,1,23,0.176667,actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her 
346,1,23,0.350833,and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um 
346,1,23,0.306429,i was i was tired um i was it was late and um 
346,1,23,0.300385,i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um 
346,1,23,0.305000,and you <yo> <sigh>
346,1,23,0.210426,it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  
346,1,23,0.261429,um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue 
346,1,23,0.288571,mm kinda petty and stupid but 
346,1,23,0.247143,at the time it it seemed 
346,1,23,0.192500,it seemed uh 
346,1,23,0.230000,viable 
346,1,23,0.245000,um 
346,1,23,0.490000,hmm

402,1,11,0.440000,oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do
402,1,11,0.450000,l_a is preferable i think to most places
402,1,11,0.321364,uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and
402,1,11,0.486000,um he loves the water
402,1,11,0.355333,but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida
402,1,11,0.290000,and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy
402,1,11,0.456667,and also have um more opportunities in business and
402,1,11,0.234000,all of the great things that it has to offer
402,1,11,0.740000,very <laughter> very easy
402,1,11,0.290000,there's not much i don't like about l_a
402,1,11,0.371111,i love l_a um i think it feels magical
402,1,11,0.466667,uh so many creative different people

402,1,11,0.950000,uh
402,1,11,0.293333,i'd rather not talk about it
402,1,11,0.331667,um i didn't go to college
402,1,11,0.410000,i'm still figuring that out
402,1,11,0.930000,um
402,1,11,0.223846,i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog
402,1,11,0.320000,um as an adult i had cats and uh
402,1,11,0.334375,um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't
402,1,11,0.320000,i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run
402,1,11,0.334545,it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing
402,1,11,0.260000,mm
402,1,11,0.456000,put on classical music <laughter>
402,1,11,0.418000,music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and

402,1,11,0.332500,go for a walk
402,1,11,0.316667,i think i'm really good at controlling my temper
402,1,11,0.295000,for the most part
402,1,11,0.590000,um before i came here <laughter>
402,1,11,0.530000,um it was just about um
402,1,11,0.705000,financial stress
402,1,11,0.830000,uh
402,1,11,1.060000,um
402,1,11,0.359286,there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question
402,1,11,0.261111,yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter>
402,1,11,0.203333,i'd rather not talk about that
402,1,11,0.578000,not very easy at all
402,1,11,0.487143,um a lot better recently but um
402,1,11,0.377500,i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so
402,1,11,0.620000,it's challenging
402,1,11,0.358889,um not to feel rested most of the time
402,1,11,0.346000,in the past week i've been feeling a lot better
402,1,11,0.750000,um yes i um
402,1,11,0.363571,the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having
402,1,11,0.359091,um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um
402,1,11,0.632000,having trouble with tolerating cold
402,1,11,0.282667,and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do
402,1,11,0.246250,and i also was sick with the flu
402,1,11,0.432222,um and in the past week i decided um
402,1,11,0.289500,that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um
402,1,11,0.325652,getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um
402,1,11,0.545000,not isolating so much
402,1,11,0.259091,and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing
402,1,11,0.359333,i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh
402,1,11,0.401818,in the past week things have taken a more positive turn
402,1,11,0.390000,no
402,1,11,0.510000,yes
402,1,11,0.790000,uh
402,1,11,0.613333,it's been quite some time officially
402,1,11,0.613333,it's probably been
402,1,11,0.324286,i don't know exactly but let's see
402,1,11,0.391667,maybe more than fifteen years ago
402,1,11,0.550000,um i was feeling suicidal
402,1,11,0.700000,no
402,1,11,0.528571,um because i found a better alternative
402,1,11,0.307692,um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen
402,1,11,0.623750,and i've tried a variety of um methods
402,1,11,0.454000,and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer
402,1,11,0.493333,and um that was really the first person that
402,1,11,0.536667,um helped me
402,1,11,0.317500,uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well
402,1,11,0.270000,and even though i've struggled with some bouts of
402,1,11,0.370000,depression it's never been anything
402,1,11,0.735000,extremely severe and um it was
402,1,11,0.252500,one of the best things that ever happened
402,1,11,0.615000,well um i was physically ill
402,1,11,0.358750,with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person
402,1,11,0.488000,um because he had cured her of that disease and
402,1,11,0.670000,um
402,1,11,0.596667,that was um
402,1,11,0.703333,he treats multiple issues and so
402,1,11,0.640000,everything is interrelated so um
402,1,11,0.290000,once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me
402,1,11,0.315000,i was so happy
402,1,11,0.480000,um i felt like i some um
402,1,11,0.443333,i felt that
402,1,11,0.362222,i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh
402,1,11,0.635000,that um
402,1,11,0.342500,<laughter> i was on cloud nine that i
402,1,11,0.241111,i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally
402,1,11,0.740000,found
402,1,11,0.502500,the answer to the
402,1,11,0.392222,solution that i was looking for i was like
402,1,11,0.206842,it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made
402,1,11,0.350000,i felt
402,1,11,0.363000,extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time
402,1,11,0.978333,<laughter> um i went to um
402,1,11,0.353333,i went to a music store
402,1,11,0.394286,because uh i had been thinking about
402,1,11,0.381111,um taking up an instrument i used to play
402,1,11,0.481429,the violin as a child and uh
402,1,11,0.288333,i've been wanting to do something
402,1,11,0.393529,that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed
402,1,11,0.445000,and um
402,1,11,0.229091,and so i went to the music store to try out
402,1,11,0.258889,um to see what it would feel like to
402,1,11,0.700000,um
402,1,11,0.373333,to handle an the instrument again

313,0,7,0.345000,uh i really like the sunshine
313,0,7,0.306667,um all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do
313,0,7,0.127500,that sort of thing
313,0,7,0.364000,uh i hate the traffic
313,0,7,0.410000,i wish the seasons were more distinct
313,0,7,0.206667,and that everything costs a lot of money here
313,0,7,0.430000,pretty easy
313,0,7,0.960000,hmm
313,0,7,0.423333,i'd say uh
313,0,7,0.336667,people are rude
313,0,7,0.850000,um
313,0,7,0.307500,not having enough money
313,0,7,0.630000,uh what else
313,0,7,0.278000,mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess
313,0,7,0.660000,<cough>
313,0,7,0.335000,i guess it depends on 
313,0,7,0.285500,what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general
313,0,7,0.770000,uh
313,0,7,0.342222,if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop
313,0,7,0.156667,is that what you're talking about
313,0,7,0.250000,okay
313,0,7,0.324167,uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be
313,0,7,0.980000,uh
313,0,7,0.324615,a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time
313,0,7,0.412500,uh pretty pissed off
313,0,7,0.366667,taken advantage of
313,0,7,0.250000,i like to go to the gym
313,0,7,0.619167,uh hang out with friends read
313,0,7,0.400000,write
313,0,7,0.147500,that sort of thing
313,0,7,0.446667,mm at times
313,0,7,1.130000,uh because
313,0,7,0.335294,sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing a lot of outward emotion
313,0,7,0.322917,i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science
313,0,7,0.330000,no
313,0,7,0.386000,i work uh in sales

313,0,7,0.313438,several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams
313,0,7,0.158333,i guess if that's a job
313,0,7,0.910000,uh
313,0,7,0.255455,i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable
313,0,7,0.307586,um let's see it was pretty different than anything i've ever experienced it was a lot of fun exposed to a lot of new things and new people 
313,0,7,0.520000,uh
313,0,7,0.420000,i was pretty young carefree good times
313,0,7,0.356923,um not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit
313,0,7,0.633333,um let's see
313,0,7,0.412308,i went to london that was a lot of fun pretty cool city
313,0,7,0.371667,little too expensive but definitely cool
313,0,7,0.396667,of what just anything in life
313,0,7,1.090000,um
313,0,7,0.540000,let's see
313,0,7,0.508571,uh boy that's a good question um
313,0,7,0.278750,moving to l_a was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was memorable i would say
313,0,7,0.450000,<sniffle>
313,0,7,0.355000,<clears throat>
313,0,7,0.590000,hmm
313,0,7,0.803333,uh maybe like
313,0,7,0.273333,six months ago
313,0,7,0.292857,uh things were just going really well
313,0,7,0.217143,didn't have much stress in my life
313,0,7,0.527500,uh yeah i'm i'm
313,0,7,0.677500,easier more easily irritated
313,0,7,0.520000,and uh
313,0,7,0.572500,yell more tired more
313,0,7,0.411429,uh kind of down feeling down more
313,0,7,0.320000,not as productive
313,0,7,0.310000,uh yeah awhile ago
313,0,7,1.030000,uh
313,0,7,0.410000,hmm
313,0,7,0.261429,mm don't know exactly it's been a few years but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume i'm still depressed
313,0,7,0.750000,um
313,0,7,0.254444,well i just i'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought
313,0,7,0.340000,that would uh
313,0,7,0.190000,be a good idea so i did it and and that's what i found out
313,0,7,0.270000,oh yeah definitely
313,0,7,0.297273,um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest 
313,0,7,0.220000,<clears throat>
313,0,7,0.430000,thanks
313,0,7,0.367200,um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff
313,0,7,0.334211,like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think
313,0,7,0.810000,hmm
313,0,7,0.400000,pretty girls
313,0,7,0.422500,<laughter> 
313,0,7,0.530000,<laughter>
313,0,7,0.980000,um
313,0,7,0.448571,i'm a good leader i'm really smart
313,0,7,0.920000,uh
313,0,7,0.536667,being able to
313,0,7,0.830000,um
313,0,7,0.257778,survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help 
313,0,7,0.375000,yeah lots of stuff
313,0,7,0.730000,um
313,0,7,0.361000,just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that
313,0,7,0.267143,looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made
313,0,7,0.990000,um
313,0,7,0.388889,i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible
313,0,7,0.550000,hmm
313,0,7,6.020000,scrubbed_entry
313,0,7,0.250000,he's always good for a
313,0,7,0.318750,sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective
313,0,7,0.890000,um
313,0,7,1.480000,talented
313,0,7,0.830000,and
313,0,7,0.293000,i don't know good at stuff i'm good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny
313,0,7,0.186667,see you later
447,0,1,1.030000,<sync>
447,0,1,0.297500,yeah that's perfectly fine
447,0,1,0.277500,i'm feeling great uh it's an early morning i don't have school
447,0,1,0.353333,i'm excited <laughter>
447,0,1,0.277500,uh born and raised in los angeles california
447,0,1,0.380000,mhm
447,0,1,0.390000,uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like
447,0,1,0.292500,do two drastically different things in one day
447,0,1,0.351250,uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh
447,0,1,0.408235,lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks
447,0,1,0.488462,uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but
447,0,1,0.335000,pretty young
447,0,1,0.645000,hmm <laughter>
447,0,1,0.348824,uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable
447,0,1,0.310667,uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old
447,0,1,0.257600,and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh
447,0,1,0.265000,we left
447,0,1,0.215000,um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change
447,0,1,0.262000,the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza
447,0,1,0.275000,it was it was delicious <laughter>
447,0,1,0.345000,yep <laughter>
447,0,1,4.240000,scrubbed_entry
447,0,1,0.495714,graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications
447,0,1,0.219000,so i can go into the military as an officer
447,0,1,0.330000,actually it's like what
447,0,1,0.220000,i don't know it's like
447,0,1,0.280000,you gotta have a plan
447,0,1,0.243636,and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me
447,0,1,0.500000,hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's
447,0,1,0.536667,however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter>
447,0,1,0.410000,yeah
447,0,1,0.330000,but uh
447,0,1,0.490000,probably
447,0,1,0.374783,i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken
447,0,1,0.300741,uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights
447,0,1,0.360000,i'm pretty good um
447,0,1,0.216923,i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year
447,0,1,0.242353,and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do
447,0,1,0.283889,decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets
447,0,1,0.510000,uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's
447,0,1,0.168000,i don't i don't know
447,0,1,0.415000,probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature
447,0,1,0.580000,um <sigh>
447,0,1,0.425000,hm <sigh>
447,0,1,0.560000,so many um
447,0,1,0.306905,i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted
447,0,1,0.292500,so it sucks but
447,0,1,0.270000,hey
447,0,1,0.495714,that is an intriguing question <sigh> um
447,0,1,0.292500,i've actually no clue
447,0,1,0.230000,the death of my grandmother
447,0,1,0.490000,sure
447,0,1,0.840000,um
447,0,1,0.246667,my grandmother died when i was eleven years old
447,0,1,0.231579,she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me
447,0,1,0.223636,she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well
447,0,1,0.352500,and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family
447,0,1,0.364000,and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother
447,0,1,0.258571,and it was it was tough but
447,0,1,0.280833,um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth
447,0,1,0.327000,and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears
447,0,1,0.396842,uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now
447,0,1,0.300000,but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them
447,0,1,0.225357,and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool
447,0,1,0.304348,fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem
447,0,1,0.302000,mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter>
447,0,1,0.293333,uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work
447,0,1,0.448333,uh sure um hm hm uh
447,0,1,0.320000,i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets
447,0,1,0.333889,and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail
447,0,1,0.332500,that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had
447,0,1,0.293750,three failure to appears in court which sucked
447,0,1,0.372500,tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so
447,0,1,0.220000,i don't know
447,0,1,0.243889,it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but
447,0,1,0.319130,there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and
447,0,1,0.380000,yeah
447,0,1,0.360000,thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate
447,0,1,0.231818,to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really
447,0,1,0.257000,so i i just bottle it up like i do
447,0,1,0.640000,everything
447,0,1,0.385294,not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe
447,0,1,0.320000,no
447,0,1,0.350000,no
447,0,1,1.110000,hm really happy oh
447,0,1,0.281250,why is that such a difficult question uh
447,0,1,0.331250,mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day
447,0,1,0.415000,seems like
447,0,1,0.930000,uh dunking
447,0,1,0.306667,across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there
447,0,1,0.240588,and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah
447,0,1,0.256667,mm i have
447,0,1,0.401538,four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each
447,0,1,0.425000,and i don't know studious hardworking
447,0,1,0.810000,determined
447,0,1,0.265000,mm i don't know
447,0,1,0.546667,<laughter> yeah <laughter>
447,0,1,0.362857,mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself
447,0,1,1.040000,hmm <sigh>
447,0,1,0.339000,i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh
447,0,1,0.613333,uh grade school
447,0,1,0.283000,i was uh i wasn't the best of students but
447,0,1,0.277209,i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad
447,0,1,0.295000,and down
447,0,1,0.359167,uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've
447,0,1,0.272105,getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential
447,0,1,1.000000,uh
447,0,1,0.250870,i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad
447,0,1,0.248667,and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully
447,0,1,0.242667,and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty
447,0,1,0.232174,yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock
447,0,1,0.284286,that was thousands of pounds didn't work
447,0,1,0.197000,but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah
447,0,1,0.445000,about that day or in general
447,0,1,0.520000,mm
447,0,1,0.281250,other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time
447,0,1,0.256667,i regret that
447,0,1,0.600000,yeah
447,0,1,2.760000,hm
447,0,1,0.356000,i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself

447,0,1,0.284000,i i have no clue
447,0,1,0.378000,that's that's an interesting question
447,0,1,0.381200,uh being the first from my immediate college <coll> uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college
447,0,1,0.335000,so yes it's it's pretty in

483,1,15,0.312500,let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike
483,1,15,0.372857,um and that that was pretty fun
483,1,15,0.435000,kinda scary and dangerous
483,1,15,0.463750,nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>
483,1,15,0.272000,traveling or just in general
483,1,15,0.750000,hmm
483,1,15,0.690000,um
483,1,15,0.486667,i gotta say
483,1,15,0.284000,i gotta say we were
483,1,15,0.318333,we were heading out of um
483,1,15,0.270000,we were
483,1,15,0.377500,heading off the p_c_h and going into um
483,1,15,0.770000,laguna
483,1,15,0.302857,and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic
483,1,15,0.688833,and i i remember going down
483,1,15,0.231393,the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click
483,1,15,0.475000,and i was like oh god
483,1,15,0.282174,and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic
483,1,15,0.237500,going down a hill
483,1,15,0.401667,unable to brake
483,1,15,0.572500,and i'm going down
483,1,15,0.695000,and suddenly
483,1,15,0.350625,there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i
483,1,15,0.610000,turn
483,1,15,0.770000,sharply
483,1,15,0.441850,in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic
483,1,15,0.423529,and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes
483,1,15,0.430000,and like not managing to keep my bike from
483,1,15,0.451667,rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot
483,1,15,0.605000,so yeah
483,1,15,0.156667,yeah that's it
483,1,15,0.610000,<laughter>
483,1,15,0.510000,um
483,1,15,0.462143,various different things uh anthropology visual effects
483,1,15,0.417250,kinda weird but yeah
483,1,15,0.630000,um
483,1,15,0.301111,i just i've always had a fascination with film
483,1,15,1.090000,and
483,1,15,0.304643,i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating
483,1,15,0.295556,just as like the the mob mentality of people
483,1,15,0.470000,especially
483,1,15,0.370000,ooh dream job
483,1,15,0.590000,um
483,1,15,0.450000,huh

483,1,15,0.244000,just a job i guess
483,1,15,0.350000,i consider myself more outgoing
483,1,15,0.530000,um
483,1,15,0.339231,you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me
483,1,15,0.234545,like people xxx i i i like people i don't know

483,1,15,0.222500,eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me
483,1,15,0.402500,i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really
483,1,15,0.290000,affect me
483,1,15,0.120000,eh
483,1,15,0.540000,um

483,1,15,0.520000,um
483,1,15,0.500000,about
483,1,15,0.373333,two years ago i broke up
483,1,15,0.498889,with like as everyone calls her my evil ex
483,1,15,0.700000,and um
483,1,15,0.469059,yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean
483,1,15,0.500000,uh
483,1,15,0.570000,eh
483,1,15,0.264545,<sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then
483,1,15,0.198750,like just as a person as a whole
483,1,15,0.434444,but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like
483,1,15,0.356250,a hundreds plus miles in a singular day
483,1,15,0.257500,and i was in a ton of pain

483,1,15,0.207500,later in the evening i got home i was like oh god
483,1,15,0.300000,like i could barely walk um
483,1,15,0.332500,and yeah i i think running off and
483,1,15,0.320588,like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like
483,1,15,0.320000,eating too much and like
483,1,15,0.580000,just
483,1,15,0.372000,overeating 'cause i was depressed
483,1,15,0.270300,but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death
483,1,15,0.622500,<deep breath> <sigh> hmm
483,1,15,0.590000,um
483,1,15,0.236667,i don't think i've had a singular hard decision
483,1,15,0.436667,i've had ever had to make
483,1,15,1.020000,because
483,1,15,0.482500,my my biggest thing
483,1,15,0.480000,in life
483,1,15,0.733333,is don't you know don't regret
483,1,15,0.310000,don't regret
483,1,15,0.285000,the the the things you do
483,1,15,0.288571,just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me
483,1,15,0.245000,that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years
483,1,15,0.374167,like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept
483,1,15,0.312000,and to answer your question
483,1,15,0.348000,i think thinking about it
483,1,15,0.294286,the hardest decision i've had to make
483,1,15,1.930000,is
483,1,15,0.575000,i'd say
483,1,15,1.470000,probably
483,1,15,0.372500,probably to break up with my ex probably
483,1,15,0.470000,um
483,1,15,0.936667,xxx <sigh> ooh
483,1,15,0.311667,um <sigh> where do i begin
483,1,15,0.810000,<sigh>
483,1,15,0.870000,um
483,1,15,0.372353,my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word
483,1,15,0.336364,um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with
483,1,15,0.293636,um just to the the people around her and to me
483,1,15,1.614000,and
483,1,15,0.870000,i
483,1,15,0.250000,<deep breath>
483,1,15,0.776667,<laughter> you know
483,1,15,0.316250,they say you're supposed to give forgive people
483,1,15,0.580000,for making mistakes or doing things
483,1,15,0.267143,and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for
483,1,15,0.283333,no matter how hard you try
483,1,15,0.308000,and i think there are some things that once done
483,1,15,0.392500,that that can't be
483,1,15,0.506000,undone they just they're they're the way that they are
483,1,15,0.363333,and i think
483,1,15,0.380000,i think after what she did
483,1,15,0.338333,i i like i just xxx
483,1,15,0.230000,eh
483,1,15,0.293636,things just fell apart after that it just it it we
483,1,15,0.485000,mm despite us trying
483,1,15,0.206667,it just it didn't work out
483,1,15,0.235000,i mean
483,1,15,0.320714,i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened
483,1,15,0.555000,oh geez
483,1,15,0.345000,oh man
483,1,15,0.306600,erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening
483,1,15,0.770000,um
483,1,15,0.348750,huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard
483,1,15,0.520000,um
483,1,15,0.710000,katrina
483,1,15,0.431429,just the experience of katrina for starters
483,1,15,0.468333,um <laughter> my <m> my ex
483,1,15,0.340000,i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina
483,1,15,0.323750,'cause that was just that that was not
483,1,15,0.336154,i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um
483,1,15,0.486000,in two thousand five um
483,1,15,0.600000,uh this giant storm hit
483,1,15,0.580000,uh
483,1,15,0.469000,new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people
483,1,15,0.363333,leveled the town
483,1,15,0.460000,um
483,1,15,0.415000,and um
483,1,15,0.244000,i i lost a lot of friends during the storm
483,1,15,0.600000,um
483,1,15,0.295556,i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it
483,1,15,0.360000,but
483,1,15,0.635000,it's still
483,1,15,0.310000,it's it's still there
483,1,15,0.353333,and i think
483,1,15,0.370000,uh i i don't know i mean
483,1,15,0.284706,you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive
483,1,15,0.324444,in that but there's just there's nothing the only
483,1,15,0.672500,thing you can do
483,1,15,0.496667,is <i> is
483,1,15,0.290714,just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again
483,1,15,0.271111,though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know
483,1,15,0.745000,<laughter> earthquakes
483,1,15,0.296667,<laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather
483,1,15,0.316000,rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming
483,1,15,0.980000,yes
483,1,15,0.420000,<laughter> yeah
483,1,15,1.420000,<sigh> um
483,1,15,0.515000,mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times
483,1,15,0.673333,that's no surprise
483,1,15,0.461000,um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school
483,1,15,0.552500,um which would've been
483,1,15,0.542727,<sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago
483,1,15,0.382500,i don't know xxx
483,1,15,0.251818,i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's
483,1,15,0.345000,it's when i first was told that i was depressed
483,1,15,0.800000,um
483,1,15,0.652000,as far as p_t_s_d goes
483,1,15,0.893333,um post katrina
483,1,15,0.830000,um
483,1,15,0.350000,and then
483,1,15,0.380000,you know
483,1,15,0.470000,uh just
483,1,15,0.353333,post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing
483,1,15,0.760000,um
483,1,15,0.391333,i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school
483,1,15,0.364000,it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school
483,1,15,0.310000,and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it

483,1,15,0.390000,don't trust her she can't be trusted
483,1,15,0.432500,um and more importantly
483,1,15,0.350000,don't
483,1,15,0.426429,<deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that

483,1,15,0.283750,yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain
483,1,15,0.325000,it's not worth it
483,1,15,0.455000,<sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive
483,1,15,0.640000,maybe

483,1,15,0.262000,i don't really feel pride
483,1,15,0.266316,i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>
483,1,15,0.223636,i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane

423,0,0,0.336667,i'm doing well
423,0,0,0.400000,los angeles the greater los angeles area
423,0,0,1.260000,people
423,0,0,1.370000,diversity
423,0,0,1.460000,and
423,0,0,0.687500,various entertainment and activities
423,0,0,0.600000,um fickle weather
423,0,0,1.100000,traffic
423,0,0,0.735000,and litter
423,0,0,0.550000,i have traveled domestically not internationally
423,0,0,0.435000,seeing other places and how people live and the culture
423,0,0,0.297000,the last trip that i went to was san diego
423,0,0,0.380000,but uh
423,0,0,0.393333,from childhood or as an adult
423,0,0,0.584444,um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach
423,0,0,0.331818,yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um
423,0,0,0.307778,this weekend is easter and we usually will go
423,0,0,0.410000,down to easter <east> easter spring break
423,0,0,0.700000,to rosarito baja
423,0,0,0.376000,um i have a bachelor's <b> bachelor's in communication studies
423,0,0,0.464000,because it's a open field
423,0,0,0.358000,just doesn't deal with um
423,0,0,0.754000,communication interactively but performing arts
423,0,0,2.000000,telecommunications
423,0,0,0.800000,business entrepreneurship so
423,0,0,0.338333,no i'm not i'm actually unemployed
423,0,0,1.000000,um
423,0,0,0.304706,i think to own my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company
423,0,0,0.910000,um
423,0,0,0.358182,i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area
423,0,0,0.503333,as a business
423,0,0,0.728000,something do online online services
423,0,0,0.282222,um i like to make things with my hands
423,0,0,0.258000,so my next venture would
423,0,0,0.540000,would be to create all natural soy candles
423,0,0,0.382500,something in that area
423,0,0,0.703333,um a mixture
423,0,0,0.403571,a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds
423,0,0,0.276000,and that's how i usually make a determination if i
423,0,0,0.466000,remain reserved or remain open
423,0,0,0.311667,i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk
423,0,0,0.364000,or go get a massage
423,0,0,0.900000,fair
423,0,0,0.600000,oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning
423,0,0,0.510000,um
423,0,0,0.304000,usually the argument is about
423,0,0,0.490000,me making myself clear
423,0,0,0.486000,or me repeating myself twice
423,0,0,0.244444,no it usually gets the other person in trouble
423,0,0,1.460000,mm
423,0,0,0.490000,i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission
423,0,0,0.316000,and i had a warranty
423,0,0,0.552222,and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs
423,0,0,0.412500,and the guy offered me a portion of
423,0,0,0.553333,the settlement agreement
423,0,0,0.264000,and i decided to take him to small claims court
423,0,0,0.306000,to get a bigger amount
423,0,0,0.305000,and i wish i would've have
423,0,0,0.412857,taken the offer that he gave me
423,0,0,0.360000,at the midst of
423,0,0,0.399167,dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs
423,0,0,0.305625,and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing
423,0,0,0.339091,the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion
423,0,0,0.288000,so i wish i would've
423,0,0,0.540000,taken the higher
423,0,0,0.320000,road than taken the lower road
423,0,0,0.346000,i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things
423,0,0,0.880000,hardest decision
423,0,0,0.803333,uh i don't know financially emotionally
423,0,0,0.540000,mm
423,0,0,0.613333,emotionally letting go a past relationship
423,0,0,0.226667,it's the hardest thing that i
423,0,0,0.277500,i won't say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing
423,0,0,0.367500,yes it was a relationship of seven years
423,0,0,0.483750,but um that person has already moved on
423,0,0,0.780000,so
423,0,0,0.318889,uh they want me to be in their life
423,0,0,0.260000,in hopes that
423,0,0,0.423750,if something goes wrong with my current relationship
423,0,0,0.308750,we'll always have something to fall back on
423,0,0,0.452000,uh yeah it is hard
423,0,0,0.773333,um an event
423,0,0,0.330000,something i could erase from my memory
423,0,0,1.040000,um
423,0,0,0.306667,i don't know <laughter> there's a lot of events
423,0,0,0.362857,that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right
423,0,0,0.990000,um
423,0,0,0.356667,probably the death of a relative
423,0,0,0.845000,um alone and misinformed
423,0,0,0.247778,because i didn't know that they were that sick
423,0,0,0.305833,and i didn't know that they were um their days were numbered
423,0,0,0.450000,and i could've had more opportunity to
423,0,0,0.483333,spend time with them and make
423,0,0,0.455000,better a better connection in the last days
423,0,0,0.980000,um
423,0,0,0.320000,it's fair to midland
423,0,0,1.050000,mm
423,0,0,0.544000,my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close
423,0,0,0.500000,my mother
423,0,0,0.464286,um yes uh she's encouraged me to
423,0,0,0.800000,continue my education
423,0,0,0.360000,to always fall back on my
423,0,0,0.692000,hobbies hopes goals and dreams
423,0,0,0.578000,she always encourages me to
423,0,0,0.505000,always stay aloof and
423,0,0,0.414286,out there looking for a better opportunity
423,0,0,0.564000,and she encourages me to
423,0,0,0.420000,not be afraid to
423,0,0,0.536667,explore other ventures
423,0,0,0.930000,easy <laughter> easy <laughter>
423,0,0,0.460000,i've been feeling well
423,0,0,1.290000,um
423,0,0,0.326000,yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that
423,0,0,0.444000,i leave the stressful environment
423,0,0,1.350000,um
423,0,0,0.426667,in the past
423,0,0,0.320000,about three years ago
423,0,0,1.080000,um
423,0,0,0.412222,because i was having issues in my learning environment
423,0,0,0.477500,and um i feeling <f> i was feeling
423,0,0,0.875000,emotionally attacked
423,0,0,0.353636,yeah i was having uh a issue with a professor who
423,0,0,0.480000,was just very
423,0,0,0.381250,i don't know a a very different personality
423,0,0,1.100000,and
423,0,0,0.383333,he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school
423,0,0,0.570000,i felt
423,0,0,0.397273,i felt um like i was in a a dishonest environment
423,0,0,0.395000,i felt
423,0,0,0.291333,like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class
423,0,0,0.249000,but i had no choice but to stay in there
423,0,0,0.315556,and deal with his meanness for the whole semester
423,0,0,0.460000,um i think through finding p_t_s_d they were trying to link depression
423,0,0,0.550000,no
423,0,0,1.050000,financially
423,0,0,0.382143,i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who is willing and committed
423,0,0,0.291000,to working with me and helping me with my issues
423,0,0,0.238182,i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me
423,0,0,0.233636,and then they laugh at me and then they tell me
423,0,0,0.460000,the opposite of what's
423,0,0,0.397500,what i'm telling them
423,0,0,0.750000,mhm
423,0,0,1.280000,mm
423,0,0,0.345000,last time i felt really happy

381,1,16,0.265556,i don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically
381,1,16,0.252667,uh pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often

381,1,16,0.250000,yeah i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone
381,1,16,0.910000,<sigh>
381,1,16,0.241429,well let's see when i was um
381,1,16,0.240000,a little kid
381,1,16,0.468571,i was outside my grandparents' uh restaurant
381,1,16,0.225500,and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving
381,1,16,0.480000,um
381,1,16,0.210714,yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could
381,1,16,0.202143,well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel
381,1,16,0.285833,so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then
381,1,16,0.410000,um
381,1,16,0.217727,you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was
381,1,16,0.246667,it was disturbing to see her
381,1,16,0.348571,you know really disturbed that way but
381,1,16,0.213684,at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it
381,1,16,0.161667,mm it was <wa> it was
381,1,16,0.490000,<laughter>
381,1,16,0.593333,<sigh> situation that
381,1,16,0.250000,<sniffle>
381,1,16,0.620000,<sigh>
381,1,16,0.310000,i don't know um
381,1,16,0.236071,well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular
381,1,16,0.600000,um
381,1,16,0.840000,maybe
381,1,16,0.216000,i think that when i was a kid i um
381,1,16,0.221111,well i think that when i was let's see
381,1,16,0.138889,well i have okay i have a good one
381,1,16,0.430000,um
381,1,16,0.206923,i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married
381,1,16,0.340000,so
381,1,16,0.168333,that's a big one for me
381,1,16,0.385000,yeah well
381,1,16,0.234444,we <w> we were together for about four years
381,1,16,0.243750,and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit
381,1,16,0.365000,and um
381,1,16,0.250333,that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that
381,1,16,0.251579,that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other
381,1,16,0.665000,but because
381,1,16,0.410000,my selfishness and because i just uh
381,1,16,0.229333,had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh
381,1,16,0.181429,i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been
381,1,16,0.470000,<sigh>
381,1,16,0.255882,well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was
381,1,16,0.340000,<sigh>
381,1,16,0.271250,no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend
381,1,16,0.242353,as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh
381,1,16,0.257241,how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't
381,1,16,0.180000,i never feel like i can help anyone
381,1,16,0.258750,who i know who has a problem so
381,1,16,0.241176,oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone
381,1,16,0.218182,all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't
381,1,16,0.287500,feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know
381,1,16,0.396667,well they're um
381,1,16,0.306667,it's very distant it's it's just
381,1,16,0.365714,it's very cordial and it's very uh
381,1,16,0.179091,uh i don't know what the word is it's on the
381,1,16,0.222308,it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all
381,1,16,0.245000,and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense
381,1,16,0.580000,so
381,1,16,0.363333,yeah it's it's
381,1,16,0.193077,i think a lot of families are that way but it it is
381,1,16,0.247778,it does bother me that mine is that way
381,1,16,0.310000,oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um
381,1,16,0.292000,yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all
381,1,16,0.328571,no not not really i would say
381,1,16,0.245000,they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so
381,1,16,0.236923,even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and
381,1,16,0.268750,no i don't think i've i've changed much
381,1,16,0.300000,mm pretty down
381,1,16,0.190000,but like i said
381,1,16,0.185714,in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again
381,1,16,0.273333,i've always been this way so
381,1,16,0.283333,it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way
381,1,16,0.490000,yes
381,1,16,0.155000,a long
381,1,16,0.241250,oh a long time ago i was um
381,1,16,0.266000,about ten years old or
381,1,16,0.270000,around there about
381,1,16,0.212222,uh i was just missing a lot of school
381,1,16,0.283846,i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to
381,1,16,0.305333,to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh
381,1,16,0.180000,it went from there
381,1,16,0.363333,no i haven't gone to therapy
381,1,16,0.352000,since i was a teenager
381,1,16,0.360000,well
381,1,16,0.177778,i didn't feel it was helping me at all
381,1,16,0.570000,so
381,1,16,0.212500,one day i just
381,1,16,0.231667,decided i didn't wanna go anymore
381,1,16,0.180000,eh
381,1,16,0.220714,uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um
381,1,16,0.206667,so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much
381,1,16,0.285000,no i wouldn't say
381,1,16,0.740000,disturbing
381,1,16,0.330000,no
381,1,16,0.530000,mm
381,1,16,0.269000,well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew
381,1,16,0.368000,and uh i have a
381,1,16,0.254783,my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them
381,1,16,0.390000,uh my ideal weekend would be um
381,1,16,0.168333,i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would
381,1,16,0.319091,really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um
381,1,16,0.272000,eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city
381,1,16,0.289333,uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and
381,1,16,0.219091,how they interact with you and how they see the world
381,1,16,0.400000,different food
381,1,16,0.540000,um
381,1,16,0.296400,and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a
381,1,16,0.720000,historical significance
381,1,16,3.850000,<laughter>
381,1,16,0.223636,oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um
381,1,16,0.218333,the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding
381,1,16,0.180606,and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town
381,1,16,0.420000,um
381,1,16,0.265833,that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was
381,1,16,0.243913,and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so
381,1,16,0.218571,yeah it was a really cool trip
381,1,16,0.680000,<sigh>
381,1,16,0.301111,<sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable
381,1,16,0.270000,uh
381,1,16,0.500000,a memorable experience
381,1,16,0.370000,probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be
381,1,16,0.259048,nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now
381,1,16,0.273333,that we should've
381,1,16,0.375000,gotten married
381,1,16,0.450000,um
381,1,16,0.255714,that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because
381,1,16,0.271429,it's it's still with me and um
381,1,16,0.243500,eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any
381,1,16,0.311111,mm particular day or any particular moment you know
381,1,16,0.365000,oh a lot um
381,1,16,0.250000,wish i could be healthier
381,1,16,0.355000,for one thing uh more energetic

381,1,16,0.225000,more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly
381,1,16,0.297500,but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social
381,1,16,0.354211,um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more
381,1,16,0.350000,and healthier
381,1,16,0.227059,oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think
381,1,16,0.238571,i think he would say that i'm
381,1,16,0.220000,a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person
381,1,16,0.292800,and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish
381,1,16,0.550000,um
381,1,16,0.292222,and probably he would say that i'm creative also
381,1,16,0.440000,<sigh> wow
381,1,16,0.330000,well my advice to to myself
381,1,16,0.323333,i don't understand the question <laughter>

381,1,16,0.276500,um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of
381,1,16,0.595000,any accomplishment

382,0,0,0.300000,it's pretty challenging but it's uh fun
382,0,0,0.232174,uh i've always had a interest <inter> interest in uh film and movies so uh it seemed like a natural pick for me
382,0,0,0.304286,uh took about a couple of years
382,0,0,0.350000,but uh
382,0,0,0.137778,i feel like i'm pretty used to it now
382,0,0,0.302727,uh i like that uh it doesn't snow it's warm weather
382,0,0,0.215000,and there's lots do to with a lot of beaches

382,0,0,0.320000,uh very good
382,0,0,0.410000,hmm
382,0,0,0.590000,uh
382,0,0,0.178000,i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate
382,0,0,0.305714,but uh it was pretty pretty tame
382,0,0,0.193333,uh i think it was a
382,0,0,0.360000,debate over sports
382,0,0,0.165714,over a basketball <ba> a basketball game
382,0,0,0.415000,and uh
382,0,0,0.264444,i was talking on facebook with somebody about it
382,0,0,0.241667,but i think it's good to
382,0,0,0.246667,uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh
382,0,0,0.316000,it's natural to you know
382,0,0,0.242000,not always agree on things
382,0,0,0.350000,so
382,0,0,0.190909,i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy
382,0,0,0.254286,i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles
382,0,0,0.460000,so uh
382,0,0,0.206364,there's no one that i i've ever had any rifts with
382,0,0,0.510000,hmm
382,0,0,0.293333,with my family
382,0,0,0.420000,hmm
382,0,0,0.270000,i probably could've been more disciplined growing up
382,0,0,0.680000,and
382,0,0,0.640000,more
382,0,0,0.520000,uh
382,0,0,0.397778,more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing
382,0,0,0.185417,but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh there's not much i would change about it
382,0,0,0.470000,hmm
382,0,0,0.278667,probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty
382,0,0,0.202500,hard but at the same time it was
382,0,0,0.395000,uh exciting
382,0,0,0.208750,so it was it was a bittersweet feeling
382,0,0,0.580000,um
382,0,0,0.308333,a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh
382,0,0,0.210000,it went away pretty quickly
382,0,0,0.390000,sure
382,0,0,0.275000,not doing better in school uh when i was in high school
382,0,0,0.250000,uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better
382,0,0,0.450000,hmm
382,0,0,0.238182,i've always had a strong support <s> uh family support system
382,0,0,0.388333,and uh parents and uh siblings
382,0,0,0.330000,so
382,0,0,0.252000,that's definitely a positive thing
382,0,0,0.510000,hmm
382,0,0,0.345000,an event
382,0,0,0.960000,uh
382,0,0,0.240000,probably going back to school i wish i would've uh
382,0,0,0.195000,wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be
382,0,0,0.450000,uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related
382,0,0,0.226667,it's pretty easy
382,0,0,0.353333,when i don't sleep well um
382,0,0,0.312500,i tend to be
382,0,0,0.530000,kinda lackadaisical and uh
382,0,0,0.291429,just tired throughout the day kinda groggy
382,0,0,0.227692,uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me
382,0,0,0.188000,i've been feeling pretty good
382,0,0,0.172000,uh no i have not
382,0,0,0.180000,uh no i haven't
382,0,0,0.322857,last time i felt really happy um
382,0,0,0.235676,i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so
382,0,0,0.298000,i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness
382,0,0,0.340000,yeah
382,0,0,0.690000,uh
382,0,0,0.260000,when i
382,0,0,0.201818,when i have money i tend to be a lot uh
382,0,0,0.485000,more even-tempered
382,0,0,0.295000,not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things
382,0,0,0.376667,and more optimistic
382,0,0,0.237619,and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game
382,0,0,0.257500,and to have uh
382,0,0,0.292000,xxx have sources of income
382,0,0,0.660000,uh
382,0,0,0.245000,i think i'm creative
382,0,0,0.271429,and i think i'm a good listener
382,0,0,0.360000,hmm
382,0,0,0.270000,to be as disciplined and focused as possible
382,0,0,0.250000,because once you're out of your
382,0,0,0.268000,parents' homes and out of their lives you have to
382,0,0,0.247222,depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um
382,0,0,0.295625,uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and
382,0,0,0.277500,a lot eh uh
382,0,0,0.168571,your life will be a lot easier
382,0,0,0.450000,hmm
382,0,0,0.320000,let's see here
382,0,0,0.270000,i wish i was more
382,0,0,0.620000,disciplined
382,0,0,0.208182,but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better
382,0,0,0.165000,at that
382,0,0,0.238333,it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so
382,0,0,0.240000,i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here
382,0,0,0.410000,hmm
382,0,0,0.810000,um
382,0,0,0.224333,some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but
382,0,0,0.332500,uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome
382,0,0,0.515000,constructive criticism
382,0,0,0.214074,'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place
382,0,0,0.230556,i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people
382,0,0,0.198571,have to say that might be negative
382,0,0,0.460000,hmm
382,0,0,0.595000,uh probably optimistic and
382,0,0,0.850000,um
382,0,0,0.696667,outgoing optimistic and
382,0,0,0.390000,uh helpful

382,0,0,0.383333,and um you know good weather
382,0,0,0.326364,uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but

382,0,0,0.222105,i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want
382,0,0,0.480000,hmm
382,0,0,0.193750,i'm not a big fan of high taxes
382,0,0,0.660000,um
382,0,0,0.230714,but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh
382,0,0,0.195000,i guess i take it in stride though

366,0,0,0.330000,he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him
366,0,0,0.259091,you know since you're my father you should act like it
366,0,0,0.346429,but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so
366,0,0,0.616667,that was um
366,0,0,0.285000,one thing
366,0,0,0.195000,oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing
366,0,0,0.488750,um and that is i wish i continued
366,0,0,0.627500,um with college throughout
366,0,0,0.271154,like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at
366,0,0,0.227500,i wanna say nineteen

366,0,0,0.285714,continued maybe that's one small thing but
366,0,0,0.282500,that's something small though
366,0,0,0.390000,yeah
366,0,0,0.540000,hmm
366,0,0,0.570000,i'm very

434,0,2,0.290652,l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a
434,0,2,0.443333,oh gang violence
434,0,2,0.310000,<laughter>
434,0,2,0.409333,no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california
434,0,2,0.395556,and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances
434,0,2,0.275000,i studied alcohol and drug counseling
434,0,2,0.242813,i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so
434,0,2,0.580000,um
434,0,2,0.297692,that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and
434,0,2,0.254000,i just went into it
434,0,2,0.228000,to do it just just to see what it was
434,0,2,0.550000,and
434,0,2,0.315000,i finished school and
434,0,2,0.471250,did a intership and got hired and so
434,0,2,0.170000,i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life
434,0,2,0.447000,i'm not working right now i actually moved away and
434,0,2,0.316000,i had to <deep breath>
434,0,2,0.250385,i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um
434,0,2,0.226667,in order to make that move
434,0,2,0.276923,but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling
434,0,2,0.600000,well
434,0,2,0.371818,it can be it can be very difficult at times because
434,0,2,0.500000,um
434,0,2,0.310476,i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly
434,0,2,0.457143,and but the regular dopes i can
434,0,2,0.209773,and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours
434,0,2,0.312105,so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um
434,0,2,0.412667,yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience
434,0,2,0.239091,and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard
434,0,2,0.310000,<laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility
434,0,2,0.540000,um
434,0,2,0.312000,or or as an author
434,0,2,0.202000,you know that depends <de>
434,0,2,0.447500,that depends on on
434,0,2,0.346000,on people mainly i mainly
434,0,2,0.285652,adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up
434,0,2,0.279231,but if people open up right away then i open up right away
434,0,2,3.065000,<laughter>
434,0,2,0.414286,i i mainly listen to music or
434,0,2,0.456667,i watch youtube
434,0,2,0.575000,write poetry
434,0,2,0.620000,um
434,0,2,0.252105,or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't
434,0,2,0.970000,so <laughter> that's
434,0,2,0.236667,and another thing i do is
434,0,2,0.592000,i eat ice cream <laughter>
434,0,2,0.307500,controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that
434,0,2,0.342143,last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was
434,0,2,0.398750,um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred
434,0,2,0.346667,i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and
434,0,2,0.285128,i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and
434,0,2,0.241765,you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it
434,0,2,0.380000,i just believe that
434,0,2,0.434615,and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um
434,0,2,0.257500,heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that
434,0,2,0.233750,well i was just telling you about um
434,0,2,0.361250,it was it was my mother's husband and
434,0,2,0.213333,to tell you the truth um
434,0,2,0.325833,i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped
434,0,2,0.303529,you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure
434,0,2,0.326413,as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um
434,0,2,0.430000,that
434,0,2,0.300476,i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so
434,0,2,0.302500,i should've just left
434,0,2,0.249091,i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um
434,0,2,0.318333,yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months
434,0,2,0.440000,so
434,0,2,0.248889,yeah those six nine months i can't get back
434,0,2,0.630000,yes
434,0,2,0.348261,well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago
434,0,2,0.247500,thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother
434,0,2,0.500000,and um
434,0,2,0.247600,my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and
434,0,2,0.350000,how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and
434,0,2,0.310000,i have family in chicago but
434,0,2,0.300000,i don't
434,0,2,0.444167,mess around with that side of the family just just because um
434,0,2,0.275000,of what i seen
434,0,2,0.294500,and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance
434,0,2,0.218571,someone who's been a positive influence <inf>
434,0,2,0.318571,influence in my life i would say
434,0,2,5.745000,scrubbed_entry
434,0,2,0.296786,taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else
434,0,2,0.610000,and
434,0,2,0.410000,taught taught me how
434,0,2,0.320667,how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until
434,0,2,0.491333,that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um
434,0,2,0.406000,and of course um he's
434,0,2,0.270000,he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got
434,0,2,0.274884,twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget
434,0,2,0.327333,feel guilty about
434,0,2,0.380000,my grandfather
434,0,2,0.310000,um passed away in two thousand four
434,0,2,0.800000,and
434,0,2,0.191000,at that time i was just getting out of prison
434,0,2,0.318421,um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he
434,0,2,0.219375,told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer
434,0,2,0.219444,but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that
434,0,2,0.324545,plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying
434,0,2,0.500000,but
434,0,2,0.273333,when he died
434,0,2,0.302500,i figured out that he was telling me
434,0,2,0.208636,that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then
434,0,2,0.650000,and
434,0,2,0.385000,i feel
434,0,2,0.168571,i think about it all the time
434,0,2,0.364286,something i can erase from my memory
434,0,2,0.380000,huh
434,0,2,0.187500,would be the day
434,0,2,0.360909,my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like
434,0,2,0.234000,that's one memory i just i can just go without
434,0,2,0.326818,replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there
434,0,2,0.437500,i felt conflicting feelings
434,0,2,0.260000,because on one hand
434,0,2,0.245000,on one hand my brother was protecting me
434,0,2,0.290000,from getting beat
434,0,2,0.238000,and on the other hand he was hitting my mom
434,0,2,0.570000,so
434,0,2,0.176000,was kinda in the middle
434,0,2,0.304000,uh most nights i don't
434,0,2,0.301724,i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep
434,0,2,0.365625,it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well
434,0,2,0.320000,i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um
434,0,2,0.248667,if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep
434,0,2,0.234000,how i been feeling lately
434,0,2,0.216000,i just been feeling like
434,0,2,0.650000,that
434,0,2,0.336667,things are about to start going better for me
434,0,2,0.422000,um making some better decisions
434,0,2,0.374545,um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people
434,0,2,0.324615,that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes
434,0,2,0.251667,i don't care if i get
434,0,2,0.406316,five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission
434,0,2,0.450000,and
434,0,2,0.258333,and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people
434,0,2,0.284714,um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before
434,0,2,0.410000,um
434,0,2,0.404167,the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering
434,0,2,0.382000,my behavior i'm more mellow
434,0,2,0.388333,um i laugh more more humorous
434,0,2,0.217500,i let a lot of things go that i used to just
434,0,2,0.312500,let tick me off
434,0,2,0.379615,and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and
434,0,2,0.354615,mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally
434,0,2,0.736667,and psychologically eh
434,0,2,0.326667,and the um
434,0,2,0.377692,acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me
434,0,2,0.670000,so
434,0,2,0.333636,i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um
434,0,2,0.289286,my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm
434,0,2,0.350000,you know um
434,0,2,0.503333,back then i just tolerated myself now i um
434,0,2,0.377273,actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you
434,0,2,0.190000,to feel the same way
434,0,2,0.297500,no no i haven't
434,0,2,0.290000,no
434,0,2,0.273333,last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game
434,0,2,0.320000,<laughter>
434,0,2,0.180000,yeah
434,0,2,0.329167,my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth
434,0,2,0.260000,because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it
434,0,2,0.356500,and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it
434,0,2,0.295882,and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people
434,0,2,0.270500,um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them
434,0,2,0.226667,like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and
434,0,2,0.423333,yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter>
434,0,2,0.510000,um
434,0,2,0.240000,i wish i would've never
434,0,2,0.312727,well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um
434,0,2,0.490000,i wish
434,0,2,0.247500,that i could change
434,0,2,0.550000,well
434,0,2,0.557143,um my economic status my employment status
434,0,2,0.350000,and um
434,0,2,0.220000,my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of
434,0,2,0.233600,stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be
434,0,2,0.530000,um
434,0,2,0.416154,confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up
434,0,2,0.239118,every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says
434,0,2,0.274000,are they looking at my teeth so i would really
434,0,2,0.445294,change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be
434,0,2,0.322727,at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it
434,0,2,0.396250,twenty years ago which would make me eighteen
434,0,2,0.309118,i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity
434,0,2,0.409259,was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i
434,0,2,0.315556,could've been playing for the lakers last night but
434,0,2,0.520000,hey

305,0,7,0.344286,i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so 
305,0,7,0.353333,uh that kinda
305,0,7,0.369355,threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off
305,0,7,0.378000,and uh i couldn't um
305,0,7,0.747500,i haven't really uh
305,0,7,0.380833,found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking
305,0,7,0.298696,and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh
305,0,7,0.830000,so

305,0,7,0.910000,dishonesty
305,0,7,0.355000,pardon me
305,0,7,0.303000,uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh
305,0,7,0.293000,you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh
305,0,7,0.426087,people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes
305,0,7,0.325000,you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that
305,0,7,0.453333,yeah big time
305,0,7,0.275714,what do i do when i'm annoyed
305,0,7,0.740000,um
305,0,7,0.332857,probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um
305,0,7,0.236034,well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis  
305,0,7,0.323636,and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek
305,0,7,0.273889,uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
305,0,7,0.347333,um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh 
305,0,7,0.516000,um i'm pretty honest with
305,0,7,0.347778,i'm open and honest about any anything and everything
305,0,7,0.430000,and uh
305,0,7,0.347255,what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just
305,0,7,0.280000,you know didn't like that at all
305,0,7,0.355000,pardon me
305,0,7,0.740000,um
305,0,7,0.232000,i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh
305,0,7,0.294762,just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh
305,0,7,0.274444,i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest 
305,0,7,0.760000,um
305,0,7,0.268696,i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
305,0,7,0.362222,you know and if you're lying about something well
305,0,7,0.534444,you just you're always having to cover up uh
305,0,7,0.276923,more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just
305,0,7,0.339750,don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship
305,0,7,0.344000,can't do nothing about it
305,0,7,0.800000,uh fun i

305,0,7,0.253538,uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so
305,0,7,0.378462,um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh
305,0,7,0.500000,going on a year um
305,0,7,0.365000,you know i uh
305,0,7,0.310000,depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um
305,0,7,0.495000,so just
305,0,7,0.246667,wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts 
305,0,7,0.410000,so 
305,0,7,0.256522,or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over
305,0,7,0.520000,so
305,0,7,0.305000,i don't
305,0,7,0.308837,lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
305,0,7,0.375455,uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
305,0,7,1.030000,um
305,0,7,0.750000,tired <laughter>
305,0,7,0.625000,um i you know
305,0,7,0.274412,if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work
305,0,7,0.600000,um
305,0,7,0.247619,and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
305,0,7,0.915000,and so
305,0,7,0.620000,you know um
305,0,7,0.294571,i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me
305,0,7,0.575000,and uh
305,0,7,0.246296,so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about
305,0,7,0.604000,you know um money um
305,0,7,0.322174,you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or
305,0,7,0.278095,mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
305,0,7,0.230000,how do i what
305,0,7,0.253333,how do i cope with them
305,0,7,1.010000,um
305,0,7,0.695000,i just
305,0,7,0.337778,try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um
305,0,7,0.424000,i just do it's uh
305,0,7,0.325714,i'm more of a guy that just
305,0,7,0.214444,you know it may take me a moment to
305,0,7,0.635000,to um
305,0,7,0.278704,say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews
305,0,7,0.393333,uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um
305,0,7,0.241935,back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me
305,0,7,0.255714,if what has gotten me in trouble
305,0,7,0.254000,my mood swing i mean
305,0,7,0.830000,um
305,0,7,0.443810,yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh
305,0,7,0.368571,uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are
305,0,7,0.362174,uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh 
305,0,7,0.475000,on uh how to interview how to uh
305,0,7,0.321765,how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh
305,0,7,0.303182,i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who 
305,0,7,0.285385,who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
305,0,7,0.820000,uh
305,0,7,0.456667,i've done uh
305,0,7,0.238929,i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and 
305,0,7,0.395000,and try to uh work on
305,0,7,0.365000,the issues that were bothering me so um
305,0,7,0.351786,you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school
305,0,7,0.525000,and uh
305,0,7,0.435000,anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
305,0,7,0.335000,pardon me
305,0,7,0.244000,i still didn't hear you
305,0,7,0.670000,that
305,0,7,0.372500,people have been deceitful
305,0,7,0.231429,can you repeat that one more time
305,0,7,0.880000,alright
305,0,7,0.425714,uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
305,0,7,0.670000,um
305,0,7,0.316250,it's tough if you don't you know um
305,0,7,0.325263,i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um
305,0,7,0.273043,again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
305,0,7,0.440000,um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and 
305,0,7,0.277000,and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um
305,0,7,0.490000,you know
305,0,7,0.240000,some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and
305,0,7,0.241111,so i just try to cope with things uh
305,0,7,0.299851,um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years
305,0,7,0.336000,actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um
305,0,7,0.338889,whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it  
305,0,7,0.255652,um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still 
305,0,7,0.328500,uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
305,0,7,0.257917,and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people
305,0,7,0.461250,um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so
305,0,7,0.850000,um
305,0,7,0.253636,but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
305,0,7,0.354375,but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um
305,0,7,0.232000,you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus
305,0,7,0.232692,that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
305,0,7,0.250000,so i just let it go
305,0,7,0.295000,i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
305,0,7,0.212222,did i have a problem before i got out
305,0,7,1.130000,uh
305,0,7,0.255862,well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people 
305,0,7,0.780000,um
305,0,7,0.261842,i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um 
305,0,7,0.222903,a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago 
305,0,7,0.352963,uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older
305,0,7,0.276667,kind of uh
305,0,7,0.352857,you know makes it work you know
305,0,7,0.368333,me me dealing with life so
305,0,7,0.375000,pardon me
305,0,7,0.432857,uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while
305,0,7,0.780000,uh recently
305,0,7,0.392632,and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um
305,0,7,0.445000,a lot of people may not understand that but uh
305,0,7,0.453333,a therapist is
305,0,7,0.287727,i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh
305,0,7,0.560000,people you know uh
305,0,7,0.740000,uh
305,0,7,0.280385,other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like
305,0,7,0.273077,you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others
305,0,7,0.247143,uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who
305,0,7,0.359500,will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
305,0,7,0.250000,but it's good to have
305,0,7,0.740000,yeah
305,0,7,0.476250,well i don't go anymore uh so um
305,0,7,0.233000,i kinda miss it you know like i said uh
305,0,7,0.730000,uh
305,0,7,0.273750,i miss it a lot actually but uh
305,0,7,0.232647,it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will
305,0,7,0.683333,um well monetary reasons and uh
305,0,7,0.355926,you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um

305,0,7,0.980000,um
305,0,7,0.342857,they would probably describe me as uh

400,0,7,0.267419,um most likely one of these trips to texas uh where we would go and spend time in the desert and shoot guns and ride go karts and stuff like that
400,0,7,0.746667,<laughter> it was
400,0,7,0.368000,uh let's see well um

400,0,7,0.640000,uh <sigh>
400,0,7,0.388889,eh just the personality that i've grown into but
400,0,7,0.280833,learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it
400,0,7,0.425000,oh tea and um
400,0,7,0.217692,you know eating i like to eat i mean that calms me down
400,0,7,0.565000,uh eh
400,0,7,0.318000,not that good when i get really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just
400,0,7,0.230000,don't
400,0,7,0.264286,get on something and i don't stop
400,0,7,0.431818,sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now
400,0,7,0.420000,<laughter> yesterday
400,0,7,0.288667,i was arguing about what sort <s> what kind of water we should be drinking
400,0,7,0.343750,uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid
400,0,7,0.520000,um
400,0,7,0.490000,even though uh the other party's opinion was somewhat
400,0,7,0.920000,misinformed
400,0,7,0.359524,um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i would've handled everything differently every day which is what
400,0,7,0.393333,um makes me grow and i
400,0,7,0.272308,try to work toward how i would've wanted to handle things every day
400,0,7,0.273333,little by little
400,0,7,0.945000,um <sigh>
400,0,7,0.308333,can't think of anyone right now
400,0,7,0.695000,um <sigh>
400,0,7,0.401667,i'd i'd i'd say uh not
400,0,7,0.500000,supporting my friends as much with their
400,0,7,0.610000,career choices
400,0,7,0.530000,<sigh>
400,0,7,0.265000,uh i'd rather not get into it <laughter>
400,0,7,0.422857,<deep breath> um <sigh> the raw food educators on youtube and <sigh> um raw vegan educators and the detox therapy <therap>
400,0,7,0.696667,therapy uh experts
400,0,7,0.352222,have been really inspirational in the past two months
400,0,7,0.284000,well uh they believe that
400,0,7,0.355000,um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and
400,0,7,0.314286,this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and
400,0,7,0.310000,um
400,0,7,0.310000,the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on
400,0,7,0.360000,you know real research <laughter>
400,0,7,0.360909,really easy i've uh almost got it down to a science
400,0,7,0.296667,uh i'm tired
400,0,7,0.400000,been feeling
400,0,7,0.240000,better than i have in a long time
400,0,7,0.264286,uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and
400,0,7,0.307500,in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know
400,0,7,0.356667,loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over
400,0,7,0.274000,my short life time of
400,0,7,0.360000,um
400,0,7,0.351429,you know toxic choices with food and
400,0,7,0.228333,drugs or whatever it would be
400,0,7,0.441875,<deep breath> yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and
400,0,7,0.432500,more control over my
400,0,7,0.340000,uh decisions and my wants versus what i need
400,0,7,0.185000,that sort of thing
400,0,7,0.550000,nope
400,0,7,0.435000,yes to some extent
400,0,7,0.298000,uh over five years ago
400,0,7,0.535000,um <sigh> lack of motivation and
400,0,7,0.360000,basically my my symptoms were
400,0,7,0.420000,paralleling that of depression
400,0,7,0.402857,uh loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear
400,0,7,0.552500,of uh social situations
400,0,7,0.325000,and uh
400,0,7,0.428333,xxx the main four or five
400,0,7,0.490000,no
400,0,7,0.313333,uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor
400,0,7,0.540000,um
400,0,7,0.285000,you know taking control of my health and
400,0,7,0.315882,experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started
400,0,7,0.336111,juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh
400,0,7,0.293333,the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that
400,0,7,0.390000,yes
400,0,7,0.430000,uh i believe therapy is useful because
400,0,7,0.337692,um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that
400,0,7,0.272500,um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that
400,0,7,0.324118,will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically
400,0,7,0.403333,um therapy um
400,0,7,0.335714,will help in overall health and mental
400,0,7,0.343333,health i believe
400,0,7,0.290000,for everybody
400,0,7,0.480000,last night um
400,0,7,0.334286,i made a really great vegan uh
400,0,7,0.364545,dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and
400,0,7,0.215000,had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter>
400,0,7,0.370000,yeah
400,0,7,0.292000,uh i would say uh
400,0,7,0.345000,you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do
400,0,7,0.328571,like my brain likes caffeine and sugar
400,0,7,0.410000,whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that xxx
400,0,7,0.220000,is an example
400,0,7,0.511250,it's very very hard it's a daily process
400,0,7,0.275000,um i was uh
400,0,7,0.503750,handling money for uh a business partner and
400,0,7,0.355000,they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of
400,0,7,0.212727,crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so
400,0,7,0.243636,the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my
400,0,7,0.342222,uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula
400,0,7,0.690000,um
400,0,7,0.360000,no
400,0,7,0.241364,twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um
400,0,7,0.353333,to start eating
400,0,7,0.300000,raw fruits and vegetables every day
400,0,7,0.566667,as calm and
400,0,7,0.480000,um
400,0,7,0.800000,sad maybe smart talented
400,0,7,0.360000,<laughter>
400,0,7,0.870000,um
400,0,7,0.369286,i really enjoyed going to the uh wholesale food market in downtown los angeles
400,0,7,0.348000,um <sigh> lots of food
400,0,7,0.344000,uh great prices you can
400,0,7,0.267222,eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket
400,0,7,0.242857,so uh i i really get in a lot of enjoyment uh teaching people
400,0,7,0.368333,how to uh maybe better themselves especially food-wise and what they're eating
400,0,7,0.402500,uh eating and um
400,0,7,0.345000,watching a really good t_v show
400,0,7,0.570000,um
400,0,7,0.434000,i'm insightful i can uh
400,0,7,0.370000,i can adjust to people's uh
400,0,7,0.930000,<sigh>
400,0,7,0.284167,uh <sigh> i dunno i guess i'll skip that question for now
400,0,7,0.498333,i'm most proud of um <sigh>
400,0,7,0.339583,i'd say my overall situation with where i'm at right now i could've never imagined that i'd be in such a fortunate um situation
400,0,7,0.385000,<deep breath> hmm <sigh>
456,0,6,0.830000,<synch>
456,0,6,0.420000,yes
456,0,6,0.232500,i'm well thank you
456,0,6,0.556667,uh boston massachusetts
456,0,6,0.510000,yes
456,0,6,0.302667,i moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one
456,0,6,0.247000,uh quite often at least a couple times a year
456,0,6,0.318800,um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love
456,0,6,0.305000,uh to pursue acting and writing
456,0,6,0.357222,mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um
456,0,6,0.338824,the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and
456,0,6,0.218519,it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality
456,0,6,0.248158,<sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path
456,0,6,0.250000,uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so
456,0,6,0.322143,sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and
456,0,6,0.169474,uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is
456,0,6,0.257966,what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here
456,0,6,0.230000,mhm
456,0,6,0.352174,mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and
456,0,6,0.255833,mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here
456,0,6,0.201429,oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family
456,0,6,0.275000,<clears throat>
456,0,6,0.363750,um one of my trips mm god well
456,0,6,0.297222,i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there
456,0,6,0.295714,always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend
456,0,6,0.206087,when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one
456,0,6,0.266667,uh in general
456,0,6,0.340000,just
456,0,6,0.267419,<clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and
456,0,6,0.227692,i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport
456,0,6,0.286522,we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was
456,0,6,0.325000,it was big monumental
456,0,6,0.530000,i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever
456,0,6,0.360000,mhm
456,0,6,0.362414,studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor
456,0,6,0.467500,writing to pursue writing
456,0,6,0.297500,writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first
456,0,6,0.520000,hard
456,0,6,0.204375,very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to
456,0,6,0.305714,i would say outgoing on in general
456,0,6,0.380435,i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise
456,0,6,0.434000,calming calming area and just
456,0,6,0.247692,just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to
456,0,6,0.246250,to come back to a calm neutral place
456,0,6,0.655000,i am
456,0,6,0.354444,getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm
456,0,6,0.278000,good at controlling my temper
456,0,6,0.252500,'cause i don't usually
456,0,6,0.224762,have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it
456,0,6,0.430000,yes
456,0,6,0.390000,no
456,0,6,0.450000,<laughter> hmm mm
456,0,6,0.537500,argued with someone um
456,0,6,0.510000,god
456,0,6,0.353333,i guess it was a friend
456,0,6,0.324000,a friend a girlfriend it
456,0,6,0.286000,it wasn't it was about
456,0,6,0.630000,uh our
456,0,6,0.403333,our each separate perspectives on a
456,0,6,0.290000,a certain situation between us that
456,0,6,0.256000,were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is
456,0,6,0.189412,this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly
456,0,6,0.770000,<sigh> hmm mm
456,0,6,0.325714,i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that
456,0,6,0.171333,it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it
456,0,6,0.460000,mm
456,0,6,0.262857,i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've
456,0,6,0.296000,made the outcome much less
456,0,6,0.590000,chaotic
456,0,6,0.480000,hmm
456,0,6,0.371667,uh i guess that would be
456,0,6,0.319375,hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and
456,0,6,0.204074,kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for
456,0,6,0.322000,sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and
456,0,6,0.246538,i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that
456,0,6,0.206667,you know you're not always gonna
456,0,6,0.187692,feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good
456,0,6,0.320000,yes
456,0,6,0.250435,i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just
456,0,6,0.330000,yeah
456,0,6,0.380000,mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be
456,0,6,0.235263,in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that
456,0,6,0.238372,my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and
456,0,6,0.206667,i could not ask for a better family they're
456,0,6,0.300000,the ideal
456,0,6,0.337143,my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and
456,0,6,0.197273,i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them
456,0,6,0.265652,it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've
456,0,6,0.225385,come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy
456,0,6,0.296190,<sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm
456,0,6,0.164167,in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and
456,0,6,0.421250,uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and
456,0,6,0.358333,just um sweat more just feel
456,0,6,0.380833,feel um just a little off
456,0,6,0.231667,i've been feeling pretty good lately
456,0,6,0.407500,mm not really just
456,0,6,0.212857,trying to be more focused <clears throat>
456,0,6,0.206667,get things done
456,0,6,0.296923,um just trying to focus on what i wanna do career-wise and really
456,0,6,0.395000,stop wasting time or you know
456,0,6,0.364615,just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing
456,0,6,0.171905,you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life
456,0,6,0.370000,no
456,0,6,0.350000,no
456,0,6,0.270000,uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and
456,0,6,0.207143,that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her
456,0,6,0.600000,probably as um  very
456,0,6,0.440000,funny
456,0,6,0.268824,humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little
456,0,6,0.353684,wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just
456,0,6,0.210000,they know they know that i'm there if they need them always
456,0,6,0.281000,my drive being more driven and just getting things done
456,0,6,0.371111,mm i guess it would be well a recent
456,0,6,0.382500,a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh
456,0,6,0.350000,yeah sort of just
456,0,6,0.300000,uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and
456,0,6,0.289655,even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel
456,0,6,0.272308,like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so
456,0,6,0.308000,i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible
456,0,6,0.251111,yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts
456,0,6,0.460000,don't second-guess yourself
456,0,6,0.491667,<sigh> <clears throat> um great listener
456,0,6,0.320000,constant sense of humor
456,0,6,0.407857,uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all
456,0,6,0.458750,just people from just all ages race gender
456,0,6,0.346316,whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just you know i just i i i'm people person

368,0,7,0.530000,geez
368,0,7,0.650000,um
368,0,7,0.181429,you know it doesn't happen too often
368,0,7,0.262500,maybe with my wife
368,0,7,0.241111,you know we were probably something silly who knows
368,0,7,0.330000,who knows
368,0,7,0.610000,um
368,0,7,0.330000,the
368,0,7,0.246774,thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um
368,0,7,0.384167,there are things that like you know um i call minor sins
368,0,7,0.278636,you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty
368,0,7,0.480000,um
368,0,7,0.302500,let's see i guess
368,0,7,0.545000,sometimes you know um
368,0,7,0.207950,you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to
368,0,7,0.253333,you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but
368,0,7,0.254000,sometimes i like to like
368,0,7,0.300000,talk to people i guess
368,0,7,0.205000,you know
368,0,7,0.432000,well that's a good question
368,0,7,0.600000,i guess
368,0,7,0.288833,i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently
368,0,7,0.236486,i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that
368,0,7,0.218750,and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like
368,0,7,0.286765,get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do
368,0,7,0.296667,you know um
368,0,7,0.229000,and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way
368,0,7,0.263462,well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way
368,0,7,0.262500,which is kinda nice
368,0,7,0.271429,um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly
368,0,7,0.650000,um
368,0,7,0.347200,uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control
368,0,7,0.242045,you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and
368,0,7,0.223393,um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think
368,0,7,0.292857,i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um
368,0,7,0.288000,that get along with me pretty well actually you know
368,0,7,0.410000,yeah
368,0,7,0.199310,um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby
368,0,7,0.380000,um the only problem i have
368,0,7,0.400000,i think
368,0,7,0.446667,is i feel
368,0,7,0.261707,like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that
368,0,7,0.230000,and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens
368,0,7,0.277000,and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good
368,0,7,0.400000,<sniffle>
368,0,7,0.478750,well right now generally i've been feeling um
368,0,7,0.506667,worried and and anxious and um
368,0,7,0.270476,you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today
368,0,7,0.197879,well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her
368,0,7,0.340000,but um
368,0,7,0.223542,you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good
368,0,7,0.246875,and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too
368,0,7,0.204000,and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like
368,0,7,0.405000,and um
368,0,7,0.201714,a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess
368,0,7,0.234255,well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate
368,0,7,0.400000,so
368,0,7,0.510000,um
368,0,7,0.191471,you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower
368,0,7,0.171250,all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way
368,0,7,0.225385,i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just
368,0,7,0.226818,more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not
368,0,7,0.331111,you know um working towards you know the goals
368,0,7,0.208261,you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um
368,0,7,0.194000,you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem
368,0,7,0.340000,like
368,0,7,0.271667,<laughter> like i wanna like uh
368,0,7,0.258571,do any of these like terrible jobs
368,0,7,0.274286,i xxx it's you know it's it's
368,0,7,0.313333,probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um
368,0,7,0.202222,you know one of these things is like uh
368,0,7,0.307143,i feel like um it is hard
368,0,7,0.284231,but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it
368,0,7,0.226842,you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it
368,0,7,0.353000,and like uh you know
368,0,7,0.245833,it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry
368,0,7,0.251818,i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with
368,0,7,0.360000,no
368,0,7,0.330000,no
368,0,7,0.370000,<grumble>
368,0,7,0.580000,man
368,0,7,0.450000,<sigh>
368,0,7,0.218947,uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe
368,0,7,0.217241,i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like
368,0,7,0.250909,not even happy about that you know i feel like um
368,0,7,0.234375,you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that
368,0,7,0.193333,it just makes me feel good
368,0,7,0.208750,you know so i i have these these
368,0,7,0.362222,these times where i'm just you know feeling good
368,0,7,0.305926,about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and
368,0,7,0.332500,and uh you know
368,0,7,0.346250,incredible that you know um it just eh
368,0,7,0.251333,you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times
368,0,7,0.229474,you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes
368,0,7,0.311875,you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know
368,0,7,0.235714,well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes
368,0,7,0.302222,who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh
368,0,7,0.207600,i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can
368,0,7,0.243462,like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know
368,0,7,0.329545,that if i got my you know diet in check um
368,0,7,0.259000,you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um
368,0,7,0.236667,my <m> my
368,0,7,0.405000,my uh
368,0,7,0.347500,i guess my my
368,0,7,0.313000,desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad
368,0,7,0.267500,and like things are so um rough that
368,0,7,0.206471,you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like
368,0,7,0.180000,it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like
368,0,7,0.533333,to um <laughter>
368,0,7,0.310000,<sigh> do things
368,0,7,0.320000,<sniffle>
368,0,7,0.216250,the one thing i regret is is not
368,0,7,0.305385,is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um
368,0,7,0.240000,you know
368,0,7,0.225098,not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like
368,0,7,0.234000,you know just to um
368,0,7,0.187692,just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh
368,0,7,0.202222,i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like
368,0,7,0.370000,like uh
368,0,7,0.333000,i mean there is a this idea of justice and
368,0,7,0.547500,and um and republicanism
368,0,7,0.269091,and you know things that i really you know adhere to
368,0,7,0.194286,that um i fall in love with
368,0,7,0.202500,and that i don't wanna get away from
368,0,7,0.232667,but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money
368,0,7,0.376923,and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that
368,0,7,0.202917,that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like
368,0,7,0.408182,like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome
368,0,7,0.340000,ugh <sigh>
368,0,7,0.300556,i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe
368,0,7,0.670000,um
368,0,7,0.218636,you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i
368,0,7,0.190000,you know regret on one hand on the other hand
368,0,7,0.203333,you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about
368,0,7,0.216667,and you know
368,0,7,0.160000,i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid
368,0,7,0.216000,i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that
368,0,7,0.247500,i think that real people have you know
368,0,7,0.254687,um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like
368,0,7,0.440000,i'm pretty happy and content with
368,0,7,0.298571,being you know the cautious you know
368,0,7,0.640000,uh
368,0,7,0.560000,<sigh>
368,0,7,0.200000,i don't know
368,0,7,0.270690,oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night
368,0,7,0.209310,and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family
368,0,7,0.226250,feel that i don't put a lot of
368,0,7,0.282500,time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my
368,0,7,0.232308,time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really
368,0,7,0.225714,you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different
368,0,7,0.170000,i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real
368,0,7,0.240000,you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it
368,0,7,0.207647,you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they
368,0,7,0.215000,you know
368,0,7,0.208421,if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor
368,0,7,0.267059,i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness
368,0,7,0.173043,i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like
368,0,7,0.250870,i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um
368,0,7,0.356667,you know uh
368,0,7,0.190667,like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends
368,0,7,0.146364,but it's the same time i i just feel like it's
368,0,7,0.261765,it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a
368,0,7,0.187436,a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know

439,0,1,0.340000,um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>
439,0,1,0.290800,oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that
439,0,1,0.233000,loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid
439,0,1,0.317143,i've won a lot of sweepstakes and
439,0,1,0.330000,uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just
439,0,1,0.277162,eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me
439,0,1,1.030000,um
439,0,1,0.367143,getting married and having my children <laughter>
439,0,1,0.150000,mm
439,0,1,0.304400,i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not
439,0,1,0.330667,and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson
439,0,1,0.391739,and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner
439,0,1,0.237500,and the other one is a computer engineer
439,0,1,0.367778,so and i've been married for thirty three years
439,0,1,0.400000,and um
439,0,1,0.602000,basically uh marriage pretty strong
439,0,1,0.316667,you know what
439,0,1,0.357500,if you build a foundation with your children
439,0,1,0.318571,and have a good relationship with them
439,0,1,0.237000,and talk to 'em and find out what's going on
439,0,1,0.246000,and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you
439,0,1,0.236250,and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you
439,0,1,0.316250,you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door
439,0,1,0.513333,that you care
439,0,1,0.248000,and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out
439,0,1,0.311111,um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem
439,0,1,0.294000,as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble
439,0,1,0.302750,and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law
439,0,1,0.348000,uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you
439,0,1,0.351304,and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son
439,0,1,0.305588,and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home
439,0,1,0.315500,on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey
439,0,1,0.279565,i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads
439,0,1,0.512500,so it pays off
439,0,1,0.266250,and i i basically he treats her well
439,0,1,0.390000,um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um
439,0,1,0.233226,for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls
439,0,1,0.250435,so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel
439,0,1,0.246316,and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they
439,0,1,0.312222,found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one
439,0,1,0.213721,and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel
439,0,1,0.195000,so i've made up for her
439,0,1,0.302381,and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there
439,0,1,0.306667,i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly
439,0,1,0.183333,so i made up for it
439,0,1,0.328000,i think before i speak
439,0,1,0.302727,and then i am the type of person also to um
439,0,1,0.416667,i take on other people's feelings before i um
439,0,1,0.265000,blurt out the wrong thing i try to
439,0,1,0.516000,uh analyze the situation first
439,0,1,0.240968,before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
439,0,1,0.770000,um
439,0,1,0.289459,<laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house
439,0,1,0.337500,uh we had a disagreement on that um
439,0,1,0.294000,men have their own way of doing things and um
439,0,1,0.337000,i had told him not to use a certain uh
439,0,1,0.314286,eh person to work on our house
439,0,1,0.311333,but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead
439,0,1,0.318571,and now he sees all the downfalls
439,0,1,0.290000,and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so
439,0,1,0.266000,but i guess he can tell by my facial expression
439,0,1,0.349412,that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money
439,0,1,0.264444,and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong
439,0,1,0.300909,and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project
439,0,1,0.309375,so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um
439,0,1,0.234286,that i can think of that's recent
439,0,1,0.369231,i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me
439,0,1,0.356897,and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um
439,0,1,0.263333,you need to do your research
439,0,1,0.292308,i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's
439,0,1,0.270625,but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money
439,0,1,0.260000,and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed
439,0,1,0.342857,he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
439,0,1,0.273636,which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money
439,0,1,0.279375,and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
439,0,1,0.277500,it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
439,0,1,0.253333,and it didn't make any sense
439,0,1,0.570000,um
439,0,1,0.360000,i retired early
439,0,1,0.325200,um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california
439,0,1,0.272667,um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen
439,0,1,0.225833,and i had like thirty one and a half years of service
439,0,1,0.271818,and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance
439,0,1,0.234063,so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but
439,0,1,0.303333,um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long
439,0,1,0.600000,um
439,0,1,0.242000,i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay
439,0,1,0.433077,um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job
439,0,1,0.423077,because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um
439,0,1,0.234792,i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up
439,0,1,0.275000,and i don't i pay very little money
439,0,1,0.400625,so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
439,0,1,0.920000,um
439,0,1,0.210000,let me see the hardest
439,0,1,0.324286,it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying
439,0,1,0.407500,and my mother um
439,0,1,0.450000,died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma
439,0,1,0.740000,and
439,0,1,0.349500,i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying
439,0,1,0.241000,or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me
439,0,1,0.232727,and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx
439,0,1,0.300000,and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order
439,0,1,0.273077,and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things
439,0,1,0.345714,you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and
439,0,1,0.207222,i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff
439,0,1,0.426250,and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting
439,0,1,0.326923,she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had
439,0,1,0.322222,a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
439,0,1,0.328333,yeah it was it was but
439,0,1,0.330625,and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um
439,0,1,0.357333,since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children
439,0,1,0.238750,that my husband and i we got together
439,0,1,0.313889,and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um

303,0,0,0.435714,well the advice i would've gave myself
303,0,0,0.353333,that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that
303,0,0,0.353333,i probably would've
303,0,0,0.387241,stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um
303,0,0,0.312727,rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um
303,0,0,0.332400,education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day
303,0,0,0.359500,so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career
303,0,0,0.366000,i'm not quite sure um
303,0,0,0.331270,you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so 
303,0,0,0.570000,yes
303,0,0,0.533333,my oldest daughter
303,0,0,0.402000,we had a argument because
303,0,0,0.700000,just
303,0,0,0.327857,the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through
303,0,0,0.400556,and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation
303,0,0,0.314000,and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know
303,0,0,0.395000,hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or 
303,0,0,0.287273,or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but
303,0,0,0.390000,that just happened you know
303,0,0,0.245000,i just told her i'm not
303,0,0,0.440000,i'm sorry
303,0,0,0.670000,very close
303,0,0,0.317826,very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life

303,0,0,0.655000,she's um
303,0,0,0.308596,she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite
303,0,0,0.254167,and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change
303,0,0,0.254848,it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but

429,0,1,0.456667,of my emotions
429,0,1,0.343000,and taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond and when and knowing not to respond
429,0,1,0.770000,um
429,0,1,0.306522,so nothing really springs  to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently
429,0,1,0.330000,oh
429,0,1,0.493333,swallowing my pride
429,0,1,0.476667,putting my tail between my legs

429,0,1,0.366667,not recent past
429,0,1,0.880000,so um

429,0,1,0.297000,hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks
429,0,1,0.336000,so any time any one of those situations you know
429,0,1,0.318889,so when i'm i think my emotional i_q has
429,0,1,0.610000,grown

458,0,5,0.375789,um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing
458,0,5,0.336774,um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter>
458,0,5,0.672500,um take a bath
458,0,5,0.381429,um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways
458,0,5,0.612222,um it needs to be worked on but um
458,0,5,0.323333,i know when to control it
458,0,5,0.266000,um when i need to
458,0,5,0.800000,um
458,0,5,0.525556,well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but
458,0,5,0.357500,um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but
458,0,5,0.378571,um that's usually how it goes <laughter>
458,0,5,0.750000,um
458,0,5,0.750000,well
458,0,5,0.336000,i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it
458,0,5,0.401364,so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess
458,0,5,1.330000,um
458,0,5,0.401176,probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um
458,0,5,0.680000,situation i wish i would've handled differently um just
458,0,5,0.347105,kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life
458,0,5,0.601538,the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that
458,0,5,0.318462,mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions
458,0,5,0.497500,um it was just a lot of um
458,0,5,0.357059,a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um
458,0,5,0.383333,if the relationship
458,0,5,0.604000,between us was still good
458,0,5,0.432500,then the things that he were doing um
458,0,5,0.343600,i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and
458,0,5,0.427083,it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and
458,0,5,0.511111,problems financial problems and he's doing this so um
458,0,5,0.350000,i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but
458,0,5,0.295000,eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so
458,0,5,0.840000,um
458,0,5,0.296667,well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes
458,0,5,1.260000,um
458,0,5,0.582000,something i can erase um
458,0,5,0.531818,mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um
458,0,5,0.376087,i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase
458,0,5,0.405455,um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems
458,0,5,0.371111,um well i would have to say my mother
458,0,5,0.880000,yes
458,0,5,0.490000,um well she's just always supported me and
458,0,5,0.565714,everything that i've done um whether it's
458,0,5,0.387500,good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing
458,0,5,0.440000,mhm
458,0,5,0.576000,um sometimes sometime it's not
458,0,5,0.313913,um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes
458,0,5,0.440000,so um that's more the problem i would like to get
458,0,5,0.410000,mhm
458,0,5,0.398000,um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap
458,0,5,0.354000,um i've been feeling fine
458,0,5,0.360000,mhm
458,0,5,0.355714,uh no they've been about the same
458,0,5,0.710000,no
458,0,5,0.430000,no
458,0,5,0.418947,um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter>
458,0,5,0.392917,um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six
458,0,5,0.383333,i really wouldn't
458,0,5,0.262667,i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom
458,0,5,0.370000,mhm
458,0,5,0.420000,so
458,0,5,0.630000,um
458,0,5,0.528571,well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in
458,0,5,0.330000,but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else
458,0,5,0.597500,uh myself well i do wish that um
458,0,5,0.419500,at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight
458,0,5,0.487500,um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up
458,0,5,0.388333,um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals
458,0,5,0.410000,so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're
458,0,5,0.355000,piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no
458,0,5,0.695385,um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive
458,0,5,0.494286,and um i'm just a good friend
458,0,5,0.440000,no
458,0,5,0.905714,um well uh twenty years ago um
458,0,5,0.312500,just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you
458,0,5,0.324286,<laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no
458,0,5,0.339500,um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when
458,0,5,0.284375,the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose
458,0,5,0.470000,um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um
458,0,5,0.422000,just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it
458,0,5,0.395556,um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter>
458,0,5,0.807000,um proud of uh <sigh>
458,0,5,0.635000,mm i guess maybe myself um
458,0,5,0.660000,my kids
458,0,5,0.343333,k thank you
458,0,5,0.480000,bye
379,0,2,0.950000,<synch>
379,0,2,0.350000,<sniffle>
379,0,2,0.440000,<sniffle>
379,0,2,0.370000,yes
379,0,2,0.245714,i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good
379,0,2,0.238333,i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there
379,0,2,0.260833,and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county
379,0,2,0.353333,about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so
379,0,2,0.260000,it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah
379,0,2,0.175000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.203571,some things that that i really like i would have to say you know
379,0,2,0.365000,the beach
379,0,2,0.373333,um you know
379,0,2,0.231667,not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um
379,0,2,0.291818,definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know
379,0,2,0.319091,just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah
379,0,2,0.200000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.180000,right
379,0,2,0.160000,yep
379,0,2,0.200000,yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot
379,0,2,0.351667,i've been to places like hawaii
379,0,2,0.497500,been to the caribbean
379,0,2,0.369000,i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth>
379,0,2,0.304286,um you know just different places like
379,0,2,0.540000,arizona i've been to oregon washington
379,0,2,0.289524,pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so
379,0,2,0.310000,yep <clears throat>
379,0,2,0.251111,um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture
379,0,2,0.355000,um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery
379,0,2,0.245385,it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say
379,0,2,0.255556,something that you know people haven't seen before so
379,0,2,0.210000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.200833,well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time
379,0,2,0.200714,new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands
379,0,2,0.281429,we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu
379,0,2,0.305000,uh maui you know places like that so
379,0,2,0.205000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.330000,yep
379,0,2,0.230000,um you know i would have to say that
379,0,2,0.268636,um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor
379,0,2,0.319231,just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so
379,0,2,0.210000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.180000,yeah
379,0,2,0.290000,i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester
379,0,2,0.248750,so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months
379,0,2,0.195000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.290000,yep
379,0,2,0.201364,well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college
379,0,2,0.267917,and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting
379,0,2,0.226000,but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me
379,0,2,0.175417,so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but
379,0,2,0.147727,you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know
379,0,2,0.289412,kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories
379,0,2,0.188889,i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so
379,0,2,0.310000,yep
379,0,2,0.610000,<laughter>
379,0,2,0.320588,my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting
379,0,2,0.321053,sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine
379,0,2,0.330000,so
379,0,2,0.205000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.261111,my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still
379,0,2,0.187500,like i said i'm twenty three years old
379,0,2,0.229444,um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but
379,0,2,0.206667,for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so
379,0,2,0.226000,things are uh you know
379,0,2,0.234000,getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well
379,0,2,0.185000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.258333,you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle
379,0,2,0.255882,you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back
379,0,2,0.187333,other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but
379,0,2,0.235000,you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before
379,0,2,0.182609,so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know
379,0,2,0.241429,i can either be talk very talkative
379,0,2,0.198621,or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and
379,0,2,0.270000,so
379,0,2,0.180000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.320000,<laughter>
379,0,2,0.364000,um you know usually um
379,0,2,0.236000,i would listen to music
379,0,2,0.225000,or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive
379,0,2,0.212105,or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know
379,0,2,0.239429,ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy
379,0,2,0.300000,so
379,0,2,0.180000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.193750,you know i've actually been better with that
379,0,2,0.272857,um couple years back you know i
379,0,2,0.224762,there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just
379,0,2,0.221667,pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but
379,0,2,0.277857,you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing
379,0,2,0.188571,and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>
379,0,2,0.239032,well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but
379,0,2,0.307778,you know it's it's always something so miniscule that
379,0,2,0.184286,that's why i probably don't remember it
379,0,2,0.218333,but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that
379,0,2,0.200909,you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances
379,0,2,0.195000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.250000,yeah
379,0,2,0.228333,something that i feel guilty about
379,0,2,0.204474,um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing
379,0,2,0.245333,but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice
379,0,2,0.180000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.251667,hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent
379,0,2,0.267368,kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got
379,0,2,0.271000,diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough
379,0,2,0.188333,and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be
379,0,2,0.214194,so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies
379,0,2,0.188571,he could be a little you know
379,0,2,0.530000,crazy
379,0,2,0.450000,so
379,0,2,0.271250,probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah
379,0,2,0.220000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.267273,yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back
379,0,2,0.224667,been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old
379,0,2,0.180556,so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to
379,0,2,0.135714,i don't i don't  you know
379,0,2,0.201667,try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah
379,0,2,0.220000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.246667,my best friend
379,0,2,0.288824,<laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy
379,0,2,0.245625,usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too
379,0,2,0.286250,um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny
379,0,2,0.213333,um i like to hang out you know just
379,0,2,0.340000,kinda
379,0,2,0.193750,do things here and there you know just
379,0,2,0.255926,normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah
379,0,2,0.195000,<clears throat
379,0,2,0.247500,you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep
379,0,2,0.178571,i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know
379,0,2,0.260000,my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough
379,0,2,0.218571,so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part
379,0,2,0.167778,i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>
379,0,2,0.575000,lately eh
379,0,2,0.216000,been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up
379,0,2,0.251000,i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago
379,0,2,0.232174,for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that
379,0,2,0.195714,um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good
379,0,2,0.242500,and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>
379,0,2,0.234118,yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but
379,0,2,0.210769,you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part
379,0,2,0.180000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.133333,i have not
379,0,2,0.170000,no
379,0,2,0.290000,nope
379,0,2,0.160000,no
379,0,2,0.306000,last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still
379,0,2,0.213077,still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave
379,0,2,0.166250,so you know we were just hanging out
379,0,2,0.255556,um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so
379,0,2,0.205000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.218333,i felt great you know it
379,0,2,0.261579,because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything
379,0,2,0.252500,can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like
379,0,2,0.220400,that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so
379,0,2,0.220000,yeah
379,0,2,0.165000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.263846,yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret
379,0,2,0.250000,um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about
379,0,2,0.210000,three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time
379,0,2,0.377273,you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances
379,0,2,0.250000,that took place
379,0,2,0.207778,so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it
379,0,2,0.138571,but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said
379,0,2,0.119375,it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way
379,0,2,0.190000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.390000,<laughter>
379,0,2,0.195714,well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if
379,0,2,0.230235,i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just
379,0,2,0.290000,be careful you know
379,0,2,0.207143,make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be
379,0,2,0.530000,um
379,0,2,0.333333,basically you know just always be nice be honest
379,0,2,0.322857,um just be caring toward others so
379,0,2,0.170000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.403333,um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing
379,0,2,0.229000,i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so
379,0,2,0.180000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.290000,yeah
379,0,2,0.300000,my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends
379,0,2,0.271000,um either you know we hang out in the day
379,0,2,0.261538,you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers
379,0,2,0.321818,um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so
379,0,2,0.165000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.207500,some things that i wish i could change
379,0,2,0.540000,um
379,0,2,0.284000,probably just you know be nicer like i said before
379,0,2,0.610000,um
379,0,2,0.430000,maybe not being as lazy have more determination
379,0,2,0.194737,i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life
379,0,2,0.169000,but i know there are times when i i kinda
379,0,2,0.287222,get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so
379,0,2,0.195000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.308000,um well you know it's it's tough to think back
379,0,2,0.209412,but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know
379,0,2,0.232857,i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have
379,0,2,0.238889,i was trying to give more constructive criticism but
379,0,2,0.190500,at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and
379,0,2,0.171667,they were out of character so
379,0,2,0.165000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.352500,my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined
379,0,2,0.245000,i'm very caring now
379,0,2,0.165000,more than i used to be
379,0,2,0.330000,very honest
379,0,2,0.285833,and you know i i just i love to talk to people
379,0,2,0.395000,like i like making new relationships
379,0,2,0.221429,i like making people laugh <clears throat>
379,0,2,0.190000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.234444,something that i did recently that i really enjoyed
379,0,2,0.254348,um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two
379,0,2,0.213333,and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so
379,0,2,0.244000,i feel accomplished about that
379,0,2,0.221000,you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there
379,0,2,0.190000,you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that
379,0,2,0.290000,so
379,0,2,0.202000,makes me feel good yep
379,0,2,0.165000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.329167,um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just
379,0,2,0.270714,usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah
379,0,2,0.175000,<clears throat>
379,0,2,0.284545,i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating
379,0,2,0.310000,high school about to graduate college
379,0,2,0.275000,hopefully you know obviously i'm gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job
379,0,2,0.165000,you know in the near future
379,0,2,0.184000,i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of
379,0,2,0.195000,<clears throat>

304,0,6,0.895000,dishonesty maybe
304,0,6,0.530000,um
304,0,6,0.346667,like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal
304,0,6,0.317143,my mom i wanna say my mom
304,0,6,0.327143,um very close we talk every day
304,0,6,0.204737,very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can

304,0,6,0.446667,it's it's good
304,0,6,0.380000,it's
304,0,6,0.215000,yes i do 
304,0,6,0.495000,um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet
304,0,6,0.264286,'cause i'm not used to that environment
304,0,6,0.347143,it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine i just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah 
304,0,6,0.406667,yes <laughter> 
304,0,6,0.359091,um i had a different option to live with somebody else
304,0,6,0.327719,and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that i live with so i kinda regret moving in with the roommates i have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever 
304,0,6,0.455000,that's fine
304,0,6,0.306000,how do i know who
304,0,6,0.250000,i
304,0,6,0.430000,yeah <laughter>
304,0,6,0.271667,there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head
304,0,6,1.590000,um
304,0,6,0.920000,um
304,0,6,0.315294,maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe 
304,0,6,0.290000,that really gets me mad
304,0,6,0.596667,mm yes 
304,0,6,0.424444,because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah
304,0,6,1.180000,yeah
304,0,6,1.100000,wow
304,0,6,0.470000,i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter>
304,0,6,0.760000,yeah
304,0,6,0.410769,oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago
304,0,6,0.305676,uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all
304,0,6,1.160000,um
304,0,6,0.523750,just her getting into grown folks' business and
304,0,6,0.235000,it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said
304,0,6,0.331964,and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> 
304,0,6,0.252857,and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people
304,0,6,0.215000,that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that
304,0,6,0.445000,yeah so but i mean we're fine now
304,0,6,0.543333,so that's good
304,0,6,0.620000,yeah
304,0,6,0.336667,to not 
304,0,6,0.437500,believe people so easily
304,0,6,0.308571,so gullible to not be so gullible
304,0,6,0.286143,i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um
304,0,6,0.325000,yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances 
304,0,6,0.610000,so
304,0,6,0.670000,yeah
304,0,6,0.303125,when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago

304,0,6,0.325500,they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so

335,1,12,0.235000,um 
335,1,12,0.703333,sometimes yeah uh
335,1,12,0.328000,certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um
335,1,12,0.316250,it happened in a in an acting class
335,1,12,0.505000,so sometimes certain teachers if they
335,1,12,0.306000,criticize in a certain way
335,1,12,0.258182,i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that
335,1,12,0.216087,someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah 
335,1,12,0.380000,no
335,1,12,0.312727,well i mean my dad is sick so not great 
335,1,12,0.361429,but um but considering not terrible 
335,1,12,0.375714,um i've been having bad dreams 
335,1,12,0.225000,uh 
335,1,12,0.200667,uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad  
335,1,12,0.200000,um 
335,1,12,0.216486,like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so     
335,1,12,0.184615,it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so  
335,1,12,0.240000,which way 
335,1,12,0.215000,okay 
335,1,12,0.307500,easy very easy

335,1,12,0.170000,yeah 
335,1,12,0.560000,um
335,1,12,0.830000,i
335,1,12,0.330000,am fairly non-judgmental 
335,1,12,0.287500,of other people i i i stay open-minded

335,1,12,0.366250,well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the u_s and uh performing for kids all over  
335,1,12,0.204444,yeah and then we ended here in l_a 
335,1,12,0.156364,yeah yeah it was great it was a good time 
335,1,12,0.260000,yeah
335,1,12,0.390000,um 
335,1,12,0.287500,lemmi think we 
335,1,12,0.355000,we went to 
335,1,12,0.240000,the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind
335,1,12,0.110000,yeah 
335,1,12,0.290000,a lot of people i i would say
335,1,12,0.280000,um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly
335,1,12,0.282667,uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well  
335,1,12,0.259143,uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and
335,1,12,0.378333,become who i am with them
335,1,12,0.120000,yeah 
335,1,12,0.310000,mhm
335,1,12,0.422000,uh small things sure 
335,1,12,0.410000,yeah
335,1,12,0.520000,uh
335,1,12,0.326667,i regret 
335,1,12,0.296667,the way that i dealt with
335,1,12,0.317000,a friendship that was ending once uh i regret 
335,1,12,0.297500,committing to certain people that i've dated 
335,1,12,0.300000,uh 
335,1,12,0.276364,but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time
335,1,12,0.188182,like being upset about things i've done in the past 
335,1,12,0.810000,hmm
335,1,12,0.256000,stand up for yourself 
335,1,12,0.265000,um 
335,1,12,0.600000,<laughter> don't date felons <laughter> uh
335,1,12,0.250000,i think that i
335,1,12,0.248182,i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself
335,1,12,0.389000,i think i i really internalize the idea of like
335,1,12,0.398000,you know women being too needy or uh or um
335,1,12,0.219322,i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that
335,1,12,0.117500,and it's still something i work on 
335,1,12,0.214286,<laughter> i'm glad you think so 
335,1,12,0.235000,um 
335,1,12,0.630000,<sigh>

490,0,2,0.266000,try to relax and breathe through it and move on
490,0,2,0.267500,depends on the context
490,0,2,0.262000,probably yesterday and my children about them not doing what they were told to do
490,0,2,0.318462,arguments with my wife where i should've probably been more patient and understanding
490,0,2,0.440000,hmm
490,0,2,0.480000,um
490,0,2,0.327368,sometimes when it's more of a hormonal period like this week i should just probably breathe through things and
490,0,2,0.312308,recognize that she's going through things and i should just be more patient
490,0,2,0.820000,um
490,0,2,0.132500,what i was gonna do with my life

490,0,2,0.230000,had the boldness to follow through with them
490,0,2,0.326667,hebrew and semitic studies and classics

490,0,2,0.291429,they need <n> need space to grow
490,0,2,0.290000,when

492,0,0,0.258333,allow your temper to come out
492,0,0,0.236400,even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot
492,0,0,0.285556,so uh i'm pretty good at controlling my temper
492,0,0,0.440000,yeah
492,0,0,1.160000,um

492,0,0,0.434286,recent that i can think of um
492,0,0,0.565000,probably say
492,0,0,0.900000,um
492,0,0,0.406667,just dealing with a neighbor uh instead of uh
492,0,0,0.285000,uh responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor altogether so i wish i had done that differently
492,0,0,0.290000,yeah
492,0,0,1.140000,hmm
492,0,0,0.890000,thankfully
492,0,0,0.293333,i've not had to make that type of decision
492,0,0,0.182000,in my life as yet
492,0,0,0.450000,mhm
492,0,0,0.690000,hmm

492,0,0,0.452000,accept it as something that
492,0,0,0.236667,has to be
492,0,0,0.191667,to get me to go forward
492,0,0,0.275000,uh i am a born again christian and so i know that
492,0,0,0.355714,that god is sovereign over my life
492,0,0,0.398750,uh and also that according to his word
492,0,0,0.197857,the bible says that every day of our life is written in his book

444,0,7,0.174000,while i was in college
444,0,7,0.330000,and had the opportunity
444,0,7,0.254545,so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher
444,0,7,0.330625,um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school
444,0,7,0.416667,and being a professor of ethics
444,0,7,0.365833,um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i

444,0,7,0.208000,every once in a while
444,0,7,0.270000,um when things are getting too chaotic
444,0,7,0.405000,at my house um
444,0,7,0.502000,and i'm feeling very underappreciated
444,0,7,0.240000,i will
444,0,7,0.260000,have a
444,0,7,0.526667,burst of anger
444,0,7,0.380476,yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation
444,0,7,0.303846,but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of
444,0,7,0.327143,um recognizing that i'm upset about it
444,0,7,0.274545,my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad
444,0,7,0.436000,and then that escalates and
444,0,7,0.450000,uh
444,0,7,0.221111,sometimes i just end up walking out the door
444,0,7,0.220000,or going to my room
444,0,7,0.300000,hmm
444,0,7,0.190000,i'm sorry
444,0,7,0.418889,um i i usually after i have an outburst
444,0,7,0.312500,and i isolate myself for a little bit
444,0,7,0.408000,i can come back relaxed
444,0,7,0.412000,and deal with the situation
444,0,7,0.220000,in a
444,0,7,0.540000,more
444,0,7,0.435000,calm manner
444,0,7,0.240000,um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to
444,0,7,0.327500,stop and and get myself out of there
444,0,7,0.321429,and and go take some deep breaths
444,0,7,0.320000,um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling
444,0,7,0.355556,why i'm being angry why why am i being
444,0,7,0.680000,um
444,0,7,0.430000,so tense
444,0,7,0.234286,and then be able to verbalize that
444,0,7,1.280000,um
444,0,7,0.242500,well i i it happens a few times when i start getting
444,0,7,0.220000,i've had a very tense day
444,0,7,0.388333,um and things haven't gone right
444,0,7,0.810000,um
444,0,7,0.270769,i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner
444,0,7,0.277143,and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework
444,0,7,0.315455,or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh
444,0,7,0.240667,uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then
444,0,7,0.350000,and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out
444,0,7,0.286000,just let me finish dinner
444,0,7,0.410000,and nobody would
444,0,7,0.266154,and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up
444,0,7,0.288750,and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to
444,0,7,0.281905,pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there
444,0,7,0.322222,um so that that i i should have um
444,0,7,0.275833,walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that
444,0,7,0.830000,um
444,0,7,0.239091,it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child
444,0,7,0.512500,um i wasn't married
444,0,7,0.442500,um <tisk> i had a very good friend
444,0,7,0.910000,um
444,0,7,0.192000,oh i was i was
444,0,7,0.352000,thirty two at the time
444,0,7,0.250833,so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion
444,0,7,0.255625,but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this
444,0,7,0.560000,um
444,0,7,0.510000,and i had
444,0,7,0.590000,um
444,0,7,0.257857,i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to
444,0,7,0.590000,um
444,0,7,0.245000,but we'd only been dating like three months
444,0,7,0.322000,and i was living with
444,0,7,0.176000,a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with
444,0,7,0.325833,um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well
444,0,7,0.271818,um i didn't know if we could raise a child together
444,0,7,0.275625,i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else
444,0,7,0.404545,um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together
444,0,7,0.279167,um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together
444,0,7,0.870000,um
444,0,7,0.502500,and uh so it was a lot of
444,0,7,0.780000,um
444,0,7,0.790000,huge decisions
444,0,7,0.224444,that were gonna determine the rest of my life
444,0,7,0.800000,um
444,0,7,0.395000,and i
444,0,7,0.462000,made the decision based on
444,0,7,0.440000,more common sense and practicality
444,0,7,0.830000,um
444,0,7,0.260000,but i don't regret that decision
444,0,7,0.207143,i think i made a good decision
444,0,7,0.228000,to marry my husband and
444,0,7,0.280000,raise our child <laughter>
444,0,7,0.341000,um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen
444,0,7,0.411875,he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering
444,0,7,0.280000,he is getting his pilot's license
444,0,7,0.262500,uh which i'm very proud of him for
444,0,7,0.388000,um then my daughter is
444,0,7,0.570000,fifteen
444,0,7,0.367500,and she loves acting
444,0,7,0.420000,uh she um she has a boyfriend
444,0,7,0.415000,who um
444,0,7,0.316000,uh they see just once a week at church basically
444,0,7,0.281429,um and they text each other constantly
444,0,7,0.260000,um she's a very very typical fifteen year old
444,0,7,0.282500,and then i have a twelve year old
444,0,7,0.466000,he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly
444,0,7,0.304000,um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house
444,0,7,0.254211,so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis
444,0,7,0.360000,no
444,0,7,0.335556,i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't
444,0,7,0.182143,my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young
444,0,7,0.482857,and um my mother kind of disconnected
444,0,7,0.296667,when that happened
444,0,7,0.289000,um so i didn't have a very warm or loving
444,0,7,0.365714,relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was
444,0,7,0.288182,um kind of on my own from a very young age
444,0,7,0.650000,um
444,0,7,0.165000,i mean she was at the house but
444,0,7,0.290000,really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have
444,0,7,0.755000,parenting skills
444,0,7,0.278889,that you know most people are are raised with
444,0,7,0.720000,um
444,0,7,0.183333,i know what not to do
444,0,7,0.414286,but sometimes it's very difficult and um
444,0,7,0.275000,i i see my friends that have you know these
444,0,7,0.340000,very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect
444,0,7,0.285000,um and it's like i i'm just not that person
444,0,7,0.360000,so i i
444,0,7,0.460000,i try and be
444,0,7,0.197000,i'm i i think i am a very good mother
444,0,7,0.452500,but i'm not um
444,0,7,0.456667,a typical mother
444,0,7,0.230000,i think i'm more
444,0,7,0.427500,um i'm more creative
444,0,7,0.228333,a lot of times i and we do a lot of things
444,0,7,0.388182,um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing
444,0,7,0.251429,actually when we go camping it's more
444,0,7,0.226667,i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home
444,0,7,0.181111,i think i'm more tense when i'm at home
444,0,7,0.203125,but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become
444,0,7,0.357500,calmer and more patient
444,0,7,0.260000,i think my patience is what
444,0,7,0.271250,um i need to work on the most
444,0,7,0.241250,i'm a been an insomniac all my life
444,0,7,0.290526,i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and
444,0,7,0.357059,um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise
444,0,7,0.434545,and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day
444,0,7,0.391111,i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired
444,0,7,0.373333,to sleep well
444,0,7,0.250000,um and that's sometimes that's hard to do
444,0,7,0.257857,um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading
444,0,7,0.247500,i'll read 'til midnight
444,0,7,0.195556,um and then i'll try and go to sleep
444,0,7,0.300000,um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again
444,0,7,0.179231,and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep
444,0,7,0.215000,yesterday i didn't feel so good i was
444,0,7,0.207273,um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday
444,0,7,0.254545,um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden
444,0,7,0.208667,and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard
444,0,7,0.272222,um so i had some more planting to do
444,0,7,0.168182,and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it
444,0,7,0.242727,um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good
444,0,7,0.261111,so i feel more positive i feel more energy
444,0,7,0.430000,so
444,0,7,0.390000,no
444,0,7,0.370000,no
444,0,7,0.930000,um
444,0,7,0.246364,i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that
444,0,7,0.232000,hasn't really helped me sleep
444,0,7,0.320000,but um
444,0,7,0.261538,it was really good because i needed one for a really long time
444,0,7,0.247692,and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane
444,0,7,0.332500,um but it was
444,0,7,0.210000,you know just like
444,0,7,0.320000,i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's
444,0,7,0.203333,it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing
444,0,7,0.218000,and it was like finally
444,0,7,0.285789,uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list
444,0,7,0.356154,um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and
444,0,7,0.251944,uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy
444,0,7,0.954000,<laughter> i don't know um
444,0,7,0.230000,i think she
444,0,7,0.390000,believes that i'm
444,0,7,0.570000,uh
444,0,7,0.320000,uh
444,0,7,0.319000,more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am
444,0,7,0.242308,at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues
444,0,7,0.450000,uh
444,0,7,0.291333,she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice
444,0,7,0.231429,um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me
444,0,7,0.300000,um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by
444,0,7,0.314000,uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic
444,0,7,0.475000,um or empathetic and
444,0,7,0.266250,uh i just i'm just there to listen
444,0,7,0.186000,and i don't need to give her any advice so
444,0,7,0.194286,i think a a good listener and
444,0,7,0.263333,good advice giver
444,0,7,0.272500,i procrastinate a lot
444,0,7,0.312222,um i start projects and i don't finish them
444,0,7,0.242424,uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and
444,0,7,0.238000,um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get
444,0,7,0.620000,almost finished
444,0,7,0.435000,and then
444,0,7,0.271000,i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest
444,0,7,0.630000,um
444,0,7,0.246000,sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them
444,0,7,0.215000,which sounds a little strange but
444,0,7,0.740000,um
444,0,7,0.250000,i i'm working on that
444,0,7,0.180000,i'm trying to get those done
444,0,7,0.687500,oh gosh <laughter> um
444,0,7,0.426667,not following through on the opportunities i had when
444,0,7,0.171429,i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree
444,0,7,0.700000,um
444,0,7,0.310000,with on a grant and things of that sort um
444,0,7,0.261250,but instead i got pregnant and got married
444,0,7,0.339231,and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed
444,0,7,0.215625,um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time
444,0,7,0.286250,where i had to fight for a directorship
444,0,7,0.278519,and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship
444,0,7,0.335000,and so i really wish so i resigned
444,0,7,0.520000,um
444,0,7,0.188750,and i wish i had stuck with that
444,0,7,0.620000,um
444,0,7,0.307333,'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and
444,0,7,0.615000,solid career
444,0,7,0.650000,um
444,0,7,0.520000,not
444,0,7,0.428750,base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses
444,0,7,0.568000,um the jobs were wonderful
444,0,7,0.620000,um
444,0,7,0.350000,but
444,0,7,0.373333,my ego got in the way
444,0,7,0.305000,and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the
444,0,7,0.270000,the
444,0,7,0.850000,egotistical
444,0,7,0.377500,reactions that i had
444,0,7,0.406154,to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well
444,0,7,0.432500,um my children actually
444,0,7,0.444545,um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal
444,0,7,0.715000,um and
444,0,7,0.264000,uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that
444,0,7,0.329545,they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl
444,0,7,0.245000,my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started
444,0,7,0.169130,and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day
444,0,7,0.181500,and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it
444,0,7,0.466667,um so that's
444,0,7,0.385000,that was
444,0,7,0.205000,one of my prouder
444,0,7,0.750000,experiences
444,0,7,0.400000,okay
444,0,7,0.200000,thank you
444,0,7,0.210000,bye
482,0,1,0.870000,<synch>
482,0,1,0.520000,yes
482,0,1,0.263333,i'm doing fine
482,0,1,0.300000,i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah
482,0,1,0.376667,i was yes
482,0,1,0.223333,uh i've never been back there
482,0,1,0.530000,um
482,0,1,0.260000,don't have any relatives there
482,0,1,0.180000,don't have a reason to go back there
482,0,1,0.770000,um
482,0,1,0.102500,<makes sound with mouth>
482,0,1,0.350000,<laughter> well my my family's here
482,0,1,0.311667,that's one uh the weather's great
482,0,1,0.242857,uh the beaches and mountains are here
482,0,1,0.193333,all those things are very good
482,0,1,0.466667,uh the traffic
482,0,1,0.213750,which is probably <probab> probably most people say
482,0,1,0.720000,um
482,0,1,0.302000,it's expensive to live here
482,0,1,0.160000,those are probably the top two
482,0,1,0.410000,uh recently i've traveled
482,0,1,0.660000,um
482,0,1,0.272727,well you get to see new places and and new people
482,0,1,0.346250,you get to learn more about other cultures
482,0,1,0.241667,and uh different ways people think
482,0,1,0.219286,oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week
482,0,1,0.110000,uh
482,0,1,0.407000,um i spent most of most of one day with
482,0,1,0.280625,with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got
482,0,1,0.254500,um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid
482,0,1,0.420000,trying to
482,0,1,0.222222,you know say you know what's this what's this
482,0,1,0.216000,uh it was very humbling
482,0,1,0.410000,um
482,0,1,0.208333,you know just just seeing that
482,0,1,0.191667,you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult
482,0,1,0.280000,i'm probably more of a shy person
482,0,1,0.254000,genetics i don't know why
482,0,1,0.437778,um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction
482,0,1,0.366667,i've also studied uh computer networking
482,0,1,0.650000,um
482,0,1,0.395000,it was
482,0,1,0.220000,i guess
482,0,1,0.480000,just uh kinda circumstances
482,0,1,0.365000,i needed
482,0,1,0.470000,the
482,0,1,0.210000,the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family
482,0,1,0.450000,and
482,0,1,0.264167,i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain
482,0,1,0.210000,mm
482,0,1,0.248750,uh it's given me a lot of opportunity
482,0,1,0.172778,but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life
482,0,1,0.456250,well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary
482,0,1,0.240000,uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall
482,0,1,0.282500,uh for four years
482,0,1,0.353333,and last year we we trained in north carolina
482,0,1,0.253333,for one year
482,0,1,0.318889,um and that was like theology and bible training
482,0,1,0.560000,um
482,0,1,0.493333,basically god put
482,0,1,0.370000,a um
482,0,1,0.398750,a desire in my heart to get beyond
482,0,1,0.377000,get beyond myself and and do something for other people
482,0,1,0.255000,to to go and
482,0,1,0.270000,and learn about another people their culture
482,0,1,0.318571,and to share the gospel with them
482,0,1,0.284000,well in my immediate family
482,0,1,0.570000,um
482,0,1,0.241250,i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters
482,0,1,0.300000,and then um
482,0,1,0.258571,but i i have one older brother
482,0,1,0.403333,uh no sisters
482,0,1,0.500000,um
482,0,1,0.188000,so what what do you wanna know about my family
482,0,1,0.480000,um
482,0,1,0.233333,i'm really close with my wife and my daughters
482,0,1,0.315625,uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped
482,0,1,0.255455,um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old
482,0,1,0.214444,even though he's he's five years older than me
482,0,1,0.293333,so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him
482,0,1,0.240714,but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents
482,0,1,0.630000,um
482,0,1,0.323333,i'd say my
482,0,1,0.198333,my youth pastor in high school
482,0,1,0.313333,he was a real real positive influence in me
482,0,1,0.570000,um
482,0,1,0.382500,just he has a
482,0,1,0.231250,he has a drive and a zeal for
482,0,1,0.365000,for pursuing the truth
482,0,1,0.510000,um
482,0,1,0.313333,and just uh
482,0,1,0.270000,studying the bible and
482,0,1,0.282857,and because of his influence that kinda
482,0,1,0.240909,put me on a path to wanting to study the bible
482,0,1,0.281250,um i think i've gotten better at it
482,0,1,0.246667,there have been
482,0,1,0.435000,times when
482,0,1,0.218333,you know i'll i'll get angry
482,0,1,0.370000,and uh
482,0,1,0.186000,you know it can just
482,0,1,0.373750,kinda really rule over me just the frustration
482,0,1,0.237000,and i'm the type of person that it takes me
482,0,1,0.255294,um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to
482,0,1,0.267500,to calm down again
482,0,1,0.365000,but i've
482,0,1,0.486667,i've learned um
482,0,1,0.400000,over time that really getting angry
482,0,1,0.335714,um and keeping that anger in doesn't
482,0,1,0.235000,it doesn't
482,0,1,0.254375,attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me
482,0,1,0.246154,and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to
482,0,1,0.306667,to keep so
482,0,1,0.217778,when <whe> when things anger me i try to
482,0,1,0.400000,uh
482,0,1,0.236250,like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it
482,0,1,0.276667,and and resolve it and come to a resolution
482,0,1,0.305333,um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem
482,0,1,0.640000,um <sigh>
482,0,1,0.250000,well a
482,0,1,0.231538,a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago
482,0,1,0.360000,um
482,0,1,0.226154,my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents
482,0,1,0.278333,and her parents had already left
482,0,1,0.310000,um eh we were just driving down to
482,0,1,0.213333,orange country area for this trip
482,0,1,0.490000,and
482,0,1,0.315000,my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed
482,0,1,0.610000,and
482,0,1,0.326667,but hadn't really
482,0,1,0.226000,in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had
482,0,1,0.265000,and so
482,0,1,0.267500,when i was trying to meet those expectations
482,0,1,0.610000,she
482,0,1,0.560000,um
482,0,1,0.262667,you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted
482,0,1,0.311429,um and kinda getting attacked for it
482,0,1,0.490000,so
482,0,1,0.211111,so then i i i started yelling at her
482,0,1,0.440000,and
482,0,1,0.231000,and we you know we had that conflict but then
482,0,1,0.202857,you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through
482,0,1,0.221429,and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
482,0,1,0.530000,um
482,0,1,0.325556,are you asking the moment of during the conflict
482,0,1,0.690000,uh
482,0,1,0.274615,very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it
482,0,1,0.280000,in your body
482,0,1,0.520000,um
482,0,1,0.243333,part partly i
482,0,1,0.222500,the i guess the
482,0,1,0.276000,anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
482,0,1,0.600000,so
482,0,1,0.277500,i would think um
482,0,1,0.253846,yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
482,0,1,0.465000,mm hmm hmm hmm
482,0,1,0.286000,i guess it was um
482,0,1,0.366667,deciding to go
482,0,1,0.292500,um to go to our training last year
482,0,1,0.206667,um i i felt that god had put on my heart that
482,0,1,0.180000,that this was something i was supposed to pursue
482,0,1,0.330000,um my wife didn't feel that way
482,0,1,0.570000,and
482,0,1,0.320000,i
482,0,1,0.224286,i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue
482,0,1,0.570000,and
482,0,1,0.241200,but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart
482,0,1,0.510000,so
482,0,1,0.310000,i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it
482,0,1,0.248824,um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um
482,0,1,0.209375,you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going
482,0,1,0.192727,uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh
482,0,1,0.225217,you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do
482,0,1,0.470000,um
482,0,1,0.282500,but then after i kinda gave that up
482,0,1,0.500000,then
482,0,1,0.290000,um
482,0,1,0.175926,then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so
482,0,1,0.231333,um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me
482,0,1,0.233571,tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory
482,0,1,0.850000,um
482,0,1,0.300000,oh let me see
482,0,1,0.380000,i'm not sure um
482,0,1,0.262857,i don't know i i can't really
482,0,1,0.344000,think of anything very traumatic
482,0,1,0.312000,um that i would wanna erase but i i think
482,0,1,0.178750,you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda
482,0,1,0.222500,shape who we are
482,0,1,0.610000,and
482,0,1,0.211429,so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase
482,0,1,0.730000,um usually
482,0,1,0.236000,usually it's not too bad
482,0,1,0.470000,um
482,0,1,0.274000,are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping
482,0,1,0.420000,um
482,0,1,0.248333,the the job i work the
482,0,1,0.305000,the um
482,0,1,0.215000,kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i
482,0,1,0.345000,so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts
482,0,1,0.330000,or graveyard shifts
482,0,1,0.390000,so
482,0,1,0.420000,um
482,0,1,0.260000,coming home in the morning
482,0,1,0.180769,you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep
482,0,1,0.194375,but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work
482,0,1,0.325000,uh it pretty easy
482,0,1,0.630000,um
482,0,1,0.236364,when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky
482,0,1,0.260000,uh
482,0,1,0.275000,i i've been feeling good lately
482,0,1,0.496667,no not really
482,0,1,0.280000,no
482,0,1,0.290000,no
482,0,1,0.910000,um
482,0,1,0.480000,hmm
482,0,1,0.320000,i don't know um
482,0,1,0.210000,can't think of anything that was
482,0,1,0.186000,kinda out of the ordinary
482,0,1,0.300000,but
482,0,1,0.490000,um
482,0,1,0.640000,yesterday
482,0,1,0.243333,we my wife and i took
482,0,1,0.215000,took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one
482,0,1,0.348000,um stayed with her grandma
482,0,1,0.200000,but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played
482,0,1,0.640000,and
482,0,1,0.162941,yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park
482,0,1,0.710000,um
482,0,1,0.188571,i i think he'd say i'm a
482,0,1,0.283333,a family man
482,0,1,0.430000,that um
482,0,1,0.290000,i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me
482,0,1,0.253333,um usually my my friend i end up doing
482,0,1,0.350000,um
482,0,1,0.202857,different work around the house for him
482,0,1,0.245714,'cause i'm kind of a handyman so
482,0,1,0.213333,so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice
482,0,1,0.660000,um
482,0,1,0.254000,i guess i would um
482,0,1,0.241111,i guess i would like to be able to
482,0,1,0.440000,um
482,0,1,0.407500,start conversations with people
482,0,1,0.560000,easier
482,0,1,0.435000,uh sometimes
482,0,1,0.316000,i have i have trouble
482,0,1,0.277500,just talking to people
482,0,1,0.182400,especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them
482,0,1,0.348750,but kinda talking to people in a group
482,0,1,0.168000,uh i wish i was a little better at that
482,0,1,0.243333,now if it's
482,0,1,0.360000,okay
482,0,1,0.180000,what what i was gonna say right before that was that um
482,0,1,0.225312,uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult
482,0,1,0.490000,uh
482,0,1,0.229091,advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago
482,0,1,0.740000,um
482,0,1,0.350000,probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life
482,0,1,0.880000,um
482,0,1,0.216667,that's about it
482,0,1,0.212000,think that would made that would've made the biggest difference
482,0,1,0.174000,in my life i think
482,0,1,0.780000,um
482,0,1,0.281250,well i have i have four kids and
482,0,1,0.181111,i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that
482,0,1,0.320000,that um
482,0,1,0.236667,you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them
482,0,1,0.228182,through their their journey in life and i hope that they
482,0,1,0.190000,end up a little
482,0,1,0.247500,better for it than
482,0,1,0.195000,than me
482,0,1,0.540000,um
482,0,1,0.250000,yeah i just hope
482,0,1,0.257500,hope kinda through them
482,0,1,0.226667,that i can
482,0,1,0.150000,you know
482,0,1,0.244000,leave <lea> leave something worthwhile
482,0,1,0.350000,you're welcome
482,0,1,0.380000,goodbye
364,0,0,0.720000,<synch>
364,0,0,0.385000,i am
364,0,0,0.298056,i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee
364,0,0,0.266857,and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today
364,0,0,0.305000,i was born and raised in los angeles
364,0,0,0.293000,and i'm one of the few locals from around here
364,0,0,0.395556,and uh i went to school away and uh
364,0,0,0.258462,but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles
364,0,0,0.483333,yes i am
364,0,0,0.527500,i like the weather
364,0,0,0.382500,having owned a vacation house in another state
364,0,0,0.240625,that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here
364,0,0,0.340000,um i like the culture i like the diversity
364,0,0,0.417500,i like the familiarity
364,0,0,0.427500,i like that beaches
364,0,0,0.256875,uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert
364,0,0,0.237778,but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that
364,0,0,0.306000,and uh i think it's a great place to live
364,0,0,0.410000,thank you
364,0,0,0.490000,well
364,0,0,0.181429,more of some maybe some of the
364,0,0,0.272273,things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
364,0,0,0.258333,say like the high tax rate
364,0,0,0.396667,which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
364,0,0,0.271818,which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
364,0,0,0.294000,i'm a small business owner
364,0,0,0.337969,so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
364,0,0,0.358889,and uh that's a big problem here in uh
364,0,0,0.955000,uh california
364,0,0,0.310417,it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
364,0,0,0.550000,also uh
364,0,0,0.288864,you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
364,0,0,0.317500,see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
364,0,0,0.295000,and that's what makes our taxes
364,0,0,0.264667,uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
364,0,0,0.410000,so that's
364,0,0,0.244073,you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
364,0,0,0.295556,i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries
364,0,0,0.700000,and uh
364,0,0,0.236667,i don't travel as much as i used to
364,0,0,0.361667,but i've traveled quite a bit
364,0,0,0.322222,and i've learned a couple of languages and uh
364,0,0,0.580000,i served
364,0,0,0.365000,i'm sorry
364,0,0,1.030000,uh
364,0,0,0.311429,i didn't really understand uh your question
364,0,0,0.279737,when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and
364,0,0,0.390000,i've been all through europe eastern europe
364,0,0,0.790000,asia
364,0,0,0.625000,south america
364,0,0,0.585000,north africa
364,0,0,0.334783,um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf
364,0,0,0.221818,'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
364,0,0,0.325455,and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
364,0,0,0.494000,and work out and uh
364,0,0,0.265714,i try to eat healthy and uh
364,0,0,0.324286,that's a big part of my life
364,0,0,0.470000,oh
364,0,0,0.700000,sure
364,0,0,0.249231,um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
364,0,0,0.248065,but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
364,0,0,0.253750,we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
364,0,0,0.340000,and rented a small flat and
364,0,0,0.311250,cooked and did our own shopping but really
364,0,0,0.195882,having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
364,0,0,0.250714,it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
364,0,0,0.225000,and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
364,0,0,0.348929,which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
364,0,0,0.311250,my mother insisted that all of us kids
364,0,0,0.326875,take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
364,0,0,0.454000,all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
364,0,0,0.226087,so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
364,0,0,0.333333,with the french
364,0,0,0.269250,you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
364,0,0,0.427000,<laughter> so that was a
364,0,0,0.890000,uh
364,0,0,0.350000,i have a few different degrees
364,0,0,0.393182,so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate
364,0,0,0.705000,and uh
364,0,0,0.350000,that was fun
364,0,0,0.241667,and i also have a masters
364,0,0,0.490000,uh degree in economics
364,0,0,0.297500,and i have a degree in crisis management
364,0,0,0.440000,so
364,0,0,0.340000,uh i found them um
364,0,0,1.110000,interesting
364,0,0,0.600000,and uh
364,0,0,0.212500,it was something that i wanted to do
364,0,0,0.246176,where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
364,0,0,0.279063,and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
364,0,0,0.226667,and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
364,0,0,0.283333,once you start going to school
364,0,0,0.261250,for a little bit you change your mind
364,0,0,0.640000,etcetera so
364,0,0,0.537500,um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
364,0,0,0.544167,for wholesale distributors of furniture products
364,0,0,0.218235,and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
364,0,0,0.254048,well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
364,0,0,0.710000,and it's
364,0,0,0.273000,pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
364,0,0,0.223636,but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
364,0,0,0.640000,hm
364,0,0,0.292200,actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
364,0,0,0.710000,and uh
364,0,0,0.840000,uh
364,0,0,0.290625,i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
364,0,0,0.605000,and uh
364,0,0,0.198947,you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
364,0,0,0.250882,but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
364,0,0,0.172128,you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
364,0,0,0.500000,so
364,0,0,0.210000,probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
364,0,0,0.475000,uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
364,0,0,0.281000,but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
364,0,0,0.347143,i think i'm more of an extrovert
364,0,0,0.376250,whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
364,0,0,0.254545,but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
364,0,0,0.692500,and be more um
364,0,0,1.030000,introverted
364,0,0,0.225972,i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
364,0,0,0.224615,oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
364,0,0,0.282500,one of my i have uh several computers at home
364,0,0,0.270833,and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
364,0,0,0.218000,i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
364,0,0,0.243421,you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
364,0,0,0.219118,it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
364,0,0,0.440000,i had
364,0,0,0.385000,it uh
364,0,0,0.401111,i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
364,0,0,0.232222,or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
364,0,0,0.260158,but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
364,0,0,0.432500,yes that was uh
364,0,0,0.232500,that was it but
364,0,0,0.264211,that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
364,0,0,0.202857,i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
364,0,0,0.358000,i think i've gotten better
364,0,0,0.458333,uh at the
364,0,0,0.211667,i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
364,0,0,0.176250,as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
364,0,0,0.282500,be a little more
364,0,0,0.263750,how do you had had the skills earlier
364,0,0,0.220750,i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
364,0,0,1.070000,um
364,0,0,0.320000,you know i
364,0,0,0.412000,i am more likely to think before i speak now
364,0,0,0.275714,whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
364,0,0,0.266250,so i might've said more things that i
364,0,0,0.367000,in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
364,0,0,0.483333,a work situation
364,0,0,0.970000,um
364,0,0,0.234677,but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
364,0,0,0.232105,i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
364,0,0,0.255000,so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
364,0,0,0.510000,oh wow
364,0,0,0.266000,you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
364,0,0,0.945000,argument um
364,0,0,1.070000,probably
364,0,0,0.890000,um
364,0,0,0.309375,my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
364,0,0,0.243000,and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
364,0,0,0.272895,basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
364,0,0,0.533333,and uh just
364,0,0,0.296364,uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
364,0,0,0.187647,us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
364,0,0,0.287667,but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
364,0,0,0.435000,butt heads
364,0,0,0.520000,so
364,0,0,0.231111,i felt like i was talking to a wall
364,0,0,0.279091,and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
364,0,0,0.242800,learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
364,0,0,0.325000,usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
364,0,0,0.260000,sometimes when we're younger we're
364,0,0,0.198095,looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
364,0,0,0.400000,but you know
364,0,0,0.270000,i'm pretty easy going and i have
364,0,0,0.630000,different
364,0,0,0.317143,ideas on raising children how she did
364,0,0,0.270000,and that was more
364,0,0,0.225147,not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really
364,0,0,0.336667,discussed those things but it was really just fundamental
364,0,0,0.287917,reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
364,0,0,0.360000,whereas other things looked good
364,0,0,0.255000,you know on paper to both of us
364,0,0,0.590000,hm
364,0,0,0.446111,there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
364,0,0,0.395000,thank you
364,0,0,1.440000,and
364,0,0,0.308571,really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
364,0,0,0.352500,and i really only invited very very close friends and family members
364,0,0,0.238947,i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of
364,0,0,0.195278,not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a
364,0,0,0.280769,i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact
364,0,0,0.293333,that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known
364,0,0,0.288684,about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but
364,0,0,0.280000,now as time's passed i wish i'd invited
364,0,0,0.325833,more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
364,0,0,0.266500,you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just
364,0,0,0.273056,and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because
364,0,0,0.285227,i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but
364,0,0,0.316500,i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little
364,0,0,0.229038,they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that
364,0,0,0.193000,you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less
364,0,0,0.185208,doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really
364,0,0,0.270522,mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
364,0,0,0.466429,um well both my parents are recently
364,0,0,0.312500,uh deceased in the last couple of years
364,0,0,0.217500,and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away
364,0,0,0.535000,in december
364,0,0,0.930000,and
364,0,0,0.260769,we're not super close like i always like i look at other families
364,0,0,0.331000,we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting
364,0,0,0.425000,i guess we're also uh different
364,0,0,0.635000,and uh
364,0,0,0.327857,i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family
364,0,0,0.209630,not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that
364,0,0,0.360000,we just
364,0,0,0.338333,never did that because we're all
364,0,0,0.373333,all so uh
364,0,0,0.615000,uh different
364,0,0,0.316500,yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but
364,0,0,0.230895,you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know
364,0,0,0.243000,but i think every family has their own sort of
364,0,0,1.100000,stuff
364,0,0,0.369583,um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from
364,0,0,0.237955,some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from
364,0,0,0.270952,you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was
364,0,0,0.294000,but i think i function
364,0,0,0.237368,pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
364,0,0,0.268571,i didn't enlist i was an officer
364,0,0,0.257500,i went to one of the service academies
364,0,0,0.580000,that
364,0,0,0.392500,um seventeen i started when after high school
364,0,0,0.284286,and i went to a service academy
364,0,0,0.260217,so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into
364,0,0,0.237273,i was but same age as everybody else that went there
364,0,0,0.450000,uh we did
364,0,0,0.560000,nineteen eighty three
364,0,0,0.650000,um
364,0,0,0.260312,just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just
364,0,0,0.285714,we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled
364,0,0,0.263333,at the time
364,0,0,0.292857,and poison gas was sprayed on us
364,0,0,0.620000,so
364,0,0,0.370000,that was a
364,0,0,0.331429,it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh
364,0,0,0.277577,too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation
364,0,0,0.240926,that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you
364,0,0,0.224545,you actually play in the game and the same with uh
364,0,0,0.201429,you know if you're in a combat
364,0,0,0.650000,unit
364,0,0,0.335556,well it made me more patriotic having grown up
364,0,0,0.695000,in california
364,0,0,0.237778,whereas people who are from all over the country
364,0,0,0.229762,and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did
364,0,0,0.309412,never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i
364,0,0,0.420000,ended up becoming uh
364,0,0,0.306667,just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country
364,0,0,0.244000,whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or
364,0,0,0.488333,georgia north dakota south dakota montana
364,0,0,0.211429,grows up with that kind of uh
364,0,0,0.240000,pride so i thought it was good and it
364,0,0,0.274286,unlike so many of my friends that
364,0,0,0.294545,they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan
364,0,0,0.293529,uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school
364,0,0,0.331667,and i got two graduate degrees
364,0,0,0.375000,and i went to work in private enterprise
364,0,0,0.630000,uh
364,0,0,0.287500,didn't care for it
364,0,0,0.274231,then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic
364,0,0,0.426667,for a number of years and
364,0,0,0.235147,then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell
364,0,0,0.880000,um
364,0,0,0.327000,at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked
364,0,0,0.261667,and again i was an officer
364,0,0,0.338750,uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile
364,0,0,0.208889,to be able to come back to los angeles
364,0,0,1.020000,uh
364,0,0,0.391667,because it was just so uh
364,0,0,0.299667,so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality
364,0,0,0.470000,so but
364,0,0,0.356000,it was a great experience
364,0,0,0.960000,um
364,0,0,0.342308,it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late
364,0,0,0.280769,and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well
364,0,0,0.221111,even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um
364,0,0,0.336000,but i generally sleep uh
364,0,0,0.390000,i generally sleep pretty well
364,0,0,0.292000,i feel pretty good lately
364,0,0,0.275000,you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but
364,0,0,0.264000,boy the last few months i feel great pretty much
364,0,0,0.336667,no not really
364,0,0,0.258333,i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
364,0,0,0.267353,um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it
364,0,0,0.890000,and
364,0,0,0.310000,you know
364,0,0,0.475000,it wasn't
364,0,0,0.577500,anything real too debilitating
364,0,0,0.232857,and i wasn't able to really function
364,0,0,0.241667,on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
364,0,0,0.243000,i do i was really against it in the past
364,0,0,0.301562,and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh
364,0,0,0.316842,my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past
364,0,0,0.260000,i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous
364,0,0,0.215000,and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it
364,0,0,0.348571,oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about
364,0,0,0.840000,life relationships
364,0,0,0.270000,and sometimes it's good talking things out with a
364,0,0,0.262258,a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger
364,0,0,0.322500,so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and
364,0,0,0.247273,i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that
364,0,0,0.261731,uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off
364,0,0,0.218750,i do have someone that i go to
364,0,0,0.580000,yeah
364,0,0,0.285000,i think it's nice
364,0,0,0.290000,you know they really
364,0,0,0.205476,if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped
364,0,0,0.203750,they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's
364,0,0,0.233636,always in the past they just help you talk through your
364,0,0,0.475000,your thoughts
364,0,0,0.265000,and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity
364,0,0,0.282857,to the situation that's why i like
364,0,0,0.239000,talking to someone who has a lot more life experience
364,0,0,0.291111,and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man
364,0,0,0.556667,so but it's
364,0,0,0.820000,um
364,0,0,0.271154,i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and
364,0,0,0.287694,was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you
364,0,0,0.284000,but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good
364,0,0,0.393333,uh this morning
364,0,0,0.237857,i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and
364,0,0,0.249474,family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather
364,0,0,0.279444,and i have a bunch of errands to run
364,0,0,0.289130,and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out
364,0,0,0.250652,and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold
364,0,0,0.255000,where i always i know that term so
364,0,0,0.181316,but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day
364,0,0,0.215000,and i looked forward to feeling the sun
364,0,0,0.480000,so
364,0,0,0.294286,uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects
364,0,0,0.267143,i'm too smart for my own good
364,0,0,0.650000,and i'm a
364,0,0,0.409615,i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational
364,0,0,0.416667,i'm very resourceful
364,0,0,0.288750,people always call me when they have issues
364,0,0,0.233750,and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go
364,0,0,0.193571,whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or
364,0,0,0.382857,you know i'm great with medical diagnoses
364,0,0,0.850000,uh
364,0,0,0.625000,and uh
364,0,0,0.257500,you know people also say i'm a lot of fun
364,0,0,0.230000,i'm fun to be with
364,0,0,0.700000,and um
364,0,0,0.249333,i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white
364,0,0,0.236000,i am what i am
364,0,0,0.380000,i don't b_s
364,0,0,0.360000,you know
364,0,0,0.423333,i'm the opposite of a politician
364,0,0,0.220179,so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them
364,0,0,0.302500,so that's pretty much
364,0,0,0.290000,no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully
364,0,0,0.251667,i like to think i do
364,0,0,1.240000,uh
364,0,0,0.267059,probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy
364,0,0,0.990000,uh
364,0,0,0.217059,i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger
364,0,0,1.070000,uh
364,0,0,0.246250,but just a lot of it's very typical

414,1,16,0.303846,it's um it's big enough we have beaches we're not land locked woo
414,1,16,0.576667,sometimes the smog
414,1,16,0.570000,the traffic
414,1,16,0.309167,the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost
414,1,16,0.373333,not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago
414,1,16,0.245556,and i've been to new york a couple times
414,1,16,0.378182,san francisco and i took a road trip across the country

414,1,16,0.430000,seeing new places
414,1,16,0.760000,um

414,1,16,0.468333,read about or seen pictures of
414,1,16,0.870000,um
414,1,16,0.445455,i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six
414,1,16,0.318462,and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time
414,1,16,0.425000,it was
414,1,16,0.288750,the coolest thing i've ever seen probably <laughter>
414,1,16,0.830000,happy
414,1,16,0.360833,and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice
414,1,16,0.276667,i haven't felt like that in a long time
414,1,16,0.342500,i was studying film
414,1,16,0.480000,it's just
414,1,16,0.332222,something i've always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start
414,1,16,0.280000,applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do
414,1,16,0.555000,and um
414,1,16,0.365000,i applied to northwestern as a film student
414,1,16,0.288889,and it just ended up being the right decision
414,1,16,0.840000,ooh <laughter>
414,1,16,0.750000,um
414,1,16,0.407500,i love making movies
414,1,16,0.405000,but part of me really loves
414,1,16,0.295000,making people laugh and being in front of the camera
414,1,16,0.790000,so
414,1,16,0.450000,uh
414,1,16,0.536667,comedian a comedic <comie> <laughter> comedic actor would be totally great but
414,1,16,0.433333,that's hard <laughter>
414,1,16,0.470000,i am super outgoing
414,1,16,0.300526,and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter>
414,1,16,0.660000,i um
414,1,16,0.383333,i like to watch mindless television
414,1,16,0.540000,like um
414,1,16,0.550000,toddlers in tiaras and um
414,1,16,0.330667,duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all
414,1,16,0.332500,i'm okay at it
414,1,16,0.740000,i
414,1,16,0.510000,get really
414,1,16,0.530000,emotional really fast but i am usually
414,1,16,0.435000,able to
414,1,16,0.292143,to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff
414,1,16,0.202500,for the most part
414,1,16,1.040000,sometimes
414,1,16,0.311579,i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily
414,1,16,0.338462,and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long
414,1,16,0.670000,um
414,1,16,0.407143,my best friend <laughter> ryan i think
414,1,16,0.652500,and it was about
414,1,16,0.517500,our relationship and just
414,1,16,0.280833,how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and
414,1,16,0.312308,uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before
414,1,16,0.560000,really hard
414,1,16,0.480000,it's um
414,1,16,0.305000,he's my best friend and i miss him
414,1,16,0.440000,but
414,1,16,0.289000,we messed up and it's just it's not the same
414,1,16,0.251429,it's like not the same friendship <laughter>
414,1,16,0.273333,me too <laughter>
414,1,16,0.725000,<laughter> too many um
414,1,16,0.675000,i guess
414,1,16,5.680000,scrubbed_entry
414,1,16,0.269000,when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend
414,1,16,0.297500,which was not okay
414,1,16,0.464000,i wish i would've just
414,1,16,0.394000,realized that this was bad
414,1,16,0.423684,and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up
414,1,16,0.272500,and then our friendship being really messed up
414,1,16,0.284167,i guess not spend as much time with him as i did
414,1,16,0.476667,be more assertive
414,1,16,0.700000,um
414,1,16,0.450000,i guess
414,1,16,0.395000,it was
414,1,16,0.595000,in november
414,1,16,0.658333,i was very depressed and suicidal
414,1,16,0.422000,so i told my friend
414,1,16,0.300000,what i was feeling
414,1,16,0.200000,and that she needed to take me to the e_r
414,1,16,0.376667,and from the e_r i had the choice to
414,1,16,0.357857,i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital
414,1,16,0.227895,and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i
414,1,16,0.307059,decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever
414,1,16,0.930000,um
414,1,16,0.580000,<exhale> it was awful
414,1,16,0.398333,it was in chicago and um
414,1,16,0.866667,it was scary
414,1,16,0.241250,i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just
414,1,16,0.352308,start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was
414,1,16,0.377778,mostly men and um they were all really old
414,1,16,0.920000,and
414,1,16,0.338947,it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter>
414,1,16,0.333333,so that was pretty scary and i just um
414,1,16,0.287143,it was really hard for me <laughter>
414,1,16,0.341739,i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies
414,1,16,0.304167,about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work
414,1,16,0.298824,i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and
414,1,16,0.276667,i wasn't talking to any of my friends and
414,1,16,0.275000,i was
414,1,16,0.441000,drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and
414,1,16,0.236250,i was just in a really bad place
414,1,16,0.345385,and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help
414,1,16,0.370000,it was
414,1,16,0.660000,um
414,1,16,0.416000,i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager
414,1,16,0.247143,and i tried to kill myself then
414,1,16,0.350000,and i um got put in therapy for quite some time
414,1,16,0.760000,so
414,1,16,0.283750,i figured i don't want to go down
414,1,16,0.362500,that bad path again
414,1,16,0.342000,i just wanna get better
414,1,16,0.266364,so i had to do it i had to get help
414,1,16,0.372857,i do i go once a week
414,1,16,0.330000,i feel like if you have the right therapist
414,1,16,0.393333,it's really useful
414,1,16,0.290000,i had one therapist that i really liked
414,1,16,0.312222,and i thought we could've gone really far but
414,1,16,0.371429,sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to
414,1,16,0.281667,i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay
414,1,16,0.330000,she's not
414,1,16,0.335000,we're not
414,1,16,0.281000,that great together but she's who i had right now
414,1,16,0.268000,it's better than nothing <laughter>
414,1,16,0.374000,not that easy at all
414,1,16,0.800000,um
414,1,16,0.430000,ever since <yawn>
414,1,16,0.272500,i got out of the hospital and start
414,1,16,0.560000,and i began medication for my depression
414,1,16,0.535000,i um
414,1,16,0.265714,just haven't been able to sleep well
414,1,16,0.317778,falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard
414,1,16,0.525000,have really
414,1,16,0.570000,crazy vivid dreams
414,1,16,0.271429,that wake me up and are disturbing
414,1,16,0.660000,um
414,1,16,0.410000,i guess just
414,1,16,0.466667,sometimes they reflect
414,1,16,0.386000,things that i'm worried about
414,1,16,0.323750,or happening in my life but they're just
414,1,16,0.264688,they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen
414,1,16,0.355714,and it's usually no you dreamed that
414,1,16,0.318667,sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up
414,1,16,0.403333,probably <laughter> like two nights ago
414,1,16,0.506667,that is a
414,1,16,0.700000,hard question
414,1,16,0.465000,i think
414,1,16,0.466667,in november <yawn>
414,1,16,0.417143,after i got out of the hospital
414,1,16,0.335000,i finally had one good day
414,1,16,0.328333,and my friend took me into
414,1,16,0.680000,downtown chicago
414,1,16,0.288571,and we went to the sears tower
414,1,16,0.355000,and got to look
414,1,16,0.259474,over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool
414,1,16,0.570000,<laughter> um probably
414,1,16,0.725000,super outgoing
414,1,16,0.294286,likes to be the center of attention
414,1,16,0.445000,funny and a little bit crazy
414,1,16,0.432222,i try not to regret things in my life
414,1,16,0.900000,oh
414,1,16,0.770000,um
414,1,16,0.342500,i would say that
414,1,16,0.437500,living is worth it
414,1,16,0.276667,and just don't be afraid to ask for help
414,1,16,0.273636,when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad
414,1,16,0.322222,um i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter>
414,1,16,0.655000,sleeping in and then
414,1,16,0.371667,catching a movie with my friends
414,1,16,0.428333,maybe going home with them and
414,1,16,0.422500,bake some cookies <laughter> eat all the cookies
414,1,16,0.400000,watch some t_v have a sleep over
414,1,16,0.348750,and then like make pancakes in the morning
414,1,16,0.251429,and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my free time
414,1,16,0.208333,go for a walk i don't know go to the beach <laughter>
414,1,16,0.511667,um that is a hard question
414,1,16,0.266000,i mean i think i've
414,1,16,0.303333,done a lot of great things in my life
414,1,16,0.490000,and um
414,1,16,0.306000,i have achieved a lot
414,1,16,0.500000,but
414,1,16,0.378571,i think one of the proudest things
414,1,16,0.408182,proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant
414,1,16,0.496250,i was doing this exercise boot camp and
414,1,16,0.293077,the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like
414,1,16,0.595000,thirty push ups and
414,1,16,0.269667,it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each
414,1,16,0.252778,and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him
414,1,16,0.276667,and i just
414,1,16,0.280455,it wasn't 'cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it
414,1,16,0.256875,and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that
414,1,16,0.183333,it was nice
414,1,16,0.284000,it meet you <laughter> bye

463,0,0,0.255385,yes uh we've known each other since we were in the third grade
463,0,0,0.416154,and we've uh we've gone to elementary middle school and high school together
463,0,0,0.250000,and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of <o> of mine
463,0,0,0.390000,i am shy
463,0,0,0.770000,um
463,0,0,0.459091,i really don't know i've i've always been a quiet person
463,0,0,0.333333,um ever since i can remember
463,0,0,0.415000,hmm what do i do i
463,0,0,0.341000,i go into my room i turn my a_c on
463,0,0,0.396250,and i just relax in my bed <laughter>
463,0,0,0.237500,i am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes
463,0,0,0.414286,the last time i argued with someone
463,0,0,0.985000,was about
463,0,0,0.900000,um
463,0,0,0.670000,work
463,0,0,0.566667,i was disappointed
463,0,0,0.468000,um not angry just disappointed
463,0,0,1.240000,because my manager
463,0,0,0.577500,he wanted me to
463,0,0,0.358889,do something faster than what i usually can handle
463,0,0,0.472000,and he already knew that
463,0,0,0.390000,um my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad
463,0,0,0.790000,mm
463,0,0,0.307500,i cannot remember one
463,0,0,0.473333,the hardest decision
463,0,0,0.458333,i ever had to make was
463,0,0,0.687500,dropping out of school
463,0,0,0.950000,um
463,0,0,0.352857,i felt that i didn't really belong
463,0,0,0.320000,uh far away from home
463,0,0,0.865000,and so
463,0,0,0.302500,i was just thinking ahead um i was in a major that i didn't really like
463,0,0,0.600000,and so
463,0,0,0.335000,i decided to just not go next semester and go back home to l_a
463,0,0,0.272222,um right now that i'm looking at it yes i i am very happy that i did that
463,0,0,0.365789,because i wouldn't have gone to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now
463,0,0,0.351667,hmm i don't have an event
463,0,0,0.940000,um
463,0,0,0.395000,it depends on the days um where i work or where i don't work

463,0,0,0.440000,and i get out at ten a_m
463,0,0,0.244167,so it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep
463,0,0,0.300000,when i don't sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy
463,0,0,0.655000,uh irritated
463,0,0,0.440000,or just frustrated with the situation
463,0,0,0.257778,lately i've been okay <o> okay i've been good

463,0,0,0.680000,hmm
463,0,0,0.360385,the last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse
463,0,0,0.410000,<laughter>
463,0,0,0.386471,my best friend would've described <des> would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy

463,0,0,0.492500,i kinda took some merchandise without buying it
463,0,0,0.398750,um it was a risk that i took
463,0,0,0.880000,but
463,0,0,0.464286,um since no one was around and
463,0,0,0.300909,the opportunity <opp> the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home

451,0,4,0.515000,but um
451,0,4,0.396000,yeah sometimes it's got it's
451,0,4,0.415000,it's um
451,0,4,0.910000,created difficulties
451,0,4,0.840000,well
451,0,4,0.245000,i can't <c> <sigh>
451,0,4,0.425000,i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like
451,0,4,0.314615,was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving
451,0,4,0.252857,and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway
451,0,4,0.240000,about four miles out of our way and i just
451,0,4,0.271667,i got very angry for about
451,0,4,0.305714,thirty seconds and then i had to
451,0,4,0.239091,calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it
451,0,4,0.308889,so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but
451,0,4,0.277500,i felt kind of
451,0,4,0.427500,bad that i overreacted
451,0,4,0.710000,um
451,0,4,0.323333,you mean in my life <laughter>
451,0,4,0.940000,manys
451,0,4,0.610000,yes
451,0,4,0.900000,um
451,0,4,0.348000,gosh there's so many <laughter>
451,0,4,0.431000,i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing
451,0,4,1.210000,information
451,0,4,0.840000,like
451,0,4,0.225000,they're not gonna use me on a job or something
451,0,4,0.486667,that i would
451,0,4,0.502500,take an attitude that
451,0,4,0.870000,um
451,0,4,0.414286,i'll find something better it's okay and
451,0,4,0.383000,move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me
451,0,4,0.640000,and
451,0,4,0.255714,you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and
451,0,4,0.243333,you know that
451,0,4,0.580000,whole uh
451,0,4,0.392500,thought process that really doesn't help the situation
451,0,4,0.223333,and i do that more often
451,0,4,0.645000,but i
451,0,4,0.370000,since i started chanting
451,0,4,0.420000,but it doesn't you know
451,0,4,0.243000,i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where
451,0,4,0.270000,i can do that
451,0,4,0.352000,um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what
451,0,4,0.453750,television to buy or something <laughter> but um
451,0,4,0.900000,um
451,0,4,0.290000,i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences
451,0,4,0.620000,and um
451,0,4,0.580000,um
451,0,4,0.488000,or leaving my  comfort
451,0,4,0.363333,zone <z> place
451,0,4,0.309167,if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place
451,0,4,0.250000,that would be a very difficult decision for me
451,0,4,0.752000,and probably leaving a relationship
451,0,4,0.676667,very hard because
451,0,4,0.304000,you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship
451,0,4,0.626667,so i usually
451,0,4,0.370000,live it out til
451,0,4,0.280000,it's for you know it's
451,0,4,0.269091,they leave or something you know it's very hard for me
451,0,4,0.225000,to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on
451,0,4,0.276364,so what i usually do is i don't make the decision
451,0,4,0.310000,and i end up suffering
451,0,4,0.455000,but longer
451,0,4,0.560000,so
451,0,4,0.580000,mhm
451,0,4,0.282500,can we move on
451,0,4,0.760000,um
451,0,4,1.130000,well
451,0,4,0.463333,uh it's hard
451,0,4,0.286364,because um i don't know if it's because i have pain
451,0,4,0.346667,in my back
451,0,4,0.345000,and neck
451,0,4,0.550000,but
451,0,4,0.335714,i i it's difficult for me to
451,0,4,0.378000,stay asleep i'd i i
451,0,4,0.266000,i don't get a um
451,0,4,0.373333,a deep sleep
451,0,4,0.840000,um
451,0,4,0.640000,but
451,0,4,0.410000,at because of
451,0,4,0.231034,uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil
451,0,4,0.251250,and that's been putting me to sleep so
451,0,4,0.375000,i have been um
451,0,4,0.460000,sleeping better because of it
451,0,4,0.288571,but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell
451,0,4,0.376000,but before that all happened
451,0,4,0.413333,i was um
451,0,4,0.333333,finding it difficult to stay asleep

451,0,4,0.467500,was going to um
451,0,4,0.600000,vegas to
451,0,4,0.344000,meet my family was my
451,0,4,0.362500,my family was flying in from cleveland to
451,0,4,0.208000,uh there we have a
451,0,4,0.442000,a relative in uh vegas
451,0,4,0.308333,and i drove with my friend
451,0,4,0.341111,and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday
451,0,4,0.980000,so
451,0,4,0.307500,we all went and
451,0,4,0.265000,had a good time in vegas
451,0,4,0.255556,i mean i was struggling through my cold but
451,0,4,0.234286,but it was fun it was nice
451,0,4,0.620000,well <laughter>
451,0,4,0.463333,uh they think i'm funny um
451,0,4,0.323333,they feel that i say it like it is
451,0,4,0.960000,um
451,0,4,0.316364,they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so
451,0,4,0.277857,people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me
451,0,4,0.385000,'cause i'll
451,0,4,0.400000,i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic
451,0,4,0.210000,but just <ju> that's just the way i talk
451,0,4,0.720000,so
451,0,4,0.810000,um my um
451,0,4,0.620000,the
451,0,4,0.357143,anger that sometimes wells up in me
451,0,4,0.300000,you know i just
451,0,4,0.417778,but although that that really made me i think
451,0,4,0.253571,a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your
451,0,4,0.431667,experiences make you who you are
451,0,4,0.326000,and how you handle them
451,0,4,0.224545,makes you who you are and if you don't have those
451,0,4,0.297500,lows you don't really know what highs are
451,0,4,0.340000,so i don't
451,0,4,0.267500,i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever
451,0,4,0.326923,but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today
451,0,4,0.328421,and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these
451,0,4,0.460000,moments where i've
451,0,4,0.362500,just blurt out you know anger or something
451,0,4,0.343750,i just wish that would happen more less
451,0,4,0.341429,that the anger parts would happen less
451,0,4,0.352500,and they are so
451,0,4,0.262000,i guess it will <laughter>
451,0,4,0.450000,happen less
451,0,4,0.760000,um
451,0,4,0.373750,don't give up hope live in the moment
451,0,4,0.760000,and um
451,0,4,0.401000,everything will everything will work out everything will work out
451,0,4,0.432000,and if you believe that
451,0,4,0.252857,then you really have nothing to fear
451,0,4,1.010000,um
451,0,4,0.610000,the fact that now
451,0,4,0.370000,and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been
451,0,4,0.458750,cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become
451,0,4,0.785000,more um
451,0,4,0.820000,compassionate person
451,0,4,0.402000,and i'm able to um
451,0,4,0.320000,uh
451,0,4,0.547500,<ss> understand people better
451,0,4,0.437273,and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too
451,0,4,0.630000,and
451,0,4,0.650000,that
451,0,4,0.345000,if you if you treat people
451,0,4,0.364000,from that respect that they're
451,0,4,0.291000,they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because
451,0,4,0.355833,you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally
451,0,4,0.288667,and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate
451,0,4,0.377500,you're you're happy and your life is happy

397,0,5,0.166667,i enjoyed it
397,0,5,2.410000,ooh
397,0,5,0.296000,it was a an everyday thing people were friendly uh
397,0,5,0.240667,finding out that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting
397,0,5,0.405000,<snort> uh i studied uh poly sci and uh sociology
397,0,5,0.545000,uh <sigh>

397,0,5,0.163333,i enjoyed it
397,0,5,0.312857,but that's uh it's not as uh
397,0,5,0.242857,as often as it was <clears throat>
397,0,5,0.284000,mainly because of the uh
397,0,5,0.238333,the sports bureaus that exist now that didn't exist when i started
397,0,5,0.178889,i still when i do i still enjoy it

397,0,5,0.370000,<snort>
397,0,5,0.227000,by when by arguing i assume you mean words uh
397,0,5,0.242857,with my youngest daughter it was about uh a year and a half ago
397,0,5,0.302857,uh well it was it stemmed over an incident i didn't like what the
397,0,5,0.180000,the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got
397,0,5,0.308125,extremely defensive and rather than deal with it she became she became angry with me <snort>
397,0,5,0.193333,i was mad
397,0,5,0.370000,uh three girls
397,0,5,0.303333,thirty eight thirty seven thirty one
397,0,5,0.596667,uh three granddaughters
397,0,5,0.256154,eleven fourteen eighteen so i haven't won an argument in a long time
397,0,5,0.167143,but i adore all six of 'em
397,0,5,1.470000,uh
397,0,5,0.220541,well now i don't really consider myself a parent <snort> since mine are grown my baby is thirty one and you never lose that but i mean i'm not parenting at this point  in my life
397,0,5,0.382500,i'm enjoying my grandchildren
397,0,5,0.176000,when i was a parent yeah it's a difficult challenge
397,0,5,0.380000,<snort>
397,0,5,0.475000,is uh
397,0,5,0.266154,getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand and don't understand
397,0,5,0.217000,and not putting your your stuff in front of theirs
397,0,5,0.330000,the hugs
397,0,5,0.264762,well my dad was was physical uh in those days you know uh nobody called child services if you got hit
397,0,5,0.500000,uh
397,0,5,0.205000,uh my mother was very loving but my dad well you know he he'd raise his hand to you if he thought it would it would uh disappoint you <snort> i never did that
397,0,5,0.296364,adored my mother <sigh> my dad uh was a hard guy
397,0,5,0.152500,but i loved him
397,0,5,0.770000,uh
397,0,5,0.286667,i never felt abused by him but i mean
397,0,5,0.202727,i the one thing i remember he said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house
397,0,5,0.530000,<snort>
397,0,5,0.311000,that's my that's kinda the the basis of our relationship
397,0,5,0.185000,my mother
397,0,5,0.325000,my kids my grandkids
397,0,5,0.278333,well i'm i'm one of i'm one of three <sigh> three sons
397,0,5,0.190417,<clear throat> so i really didn't have any experience with females other than uh with my mother in terms of being you know related
397,0,5,0.206667,and my grandma
397,0,5,0.213478,and then when my first daughter was born it was like wow <snort> that was it i fell madly in love with her
397,0,5,0.273333,changed my life
397,0,5,0.157143,yeah well that's the way it happened
397,0,5,0.865000,uh <sigh>
397,0,5,0.193684,when my mother got sick i i wasn't <wa> i wasn't there for her the way i should've been
397,0,5,0.173333,and i don't feel good <goo>
397,0,5,0.199231,oh yeah you can always fix what you did in the end <snort>
397,0,5,0.230000,i was just in a real bad situation
397,0,5,0.208667,but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i shold've been
397,0,5,0.148333,at least not in my mind
397,0,5,0.805000,uh <sigh>
397,0,5,0.425714,uh my second marriage probably she uh
397,0,5,0.218125,she wanted to have uh children and i already had my children with my first wife
397,0,5,0.365000,and uh
397,0,5,0.234762,i i had i had told her initially that i did not wanna have children and you know i had three
397,0,5,0.327097,uh that and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children <sniff> so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant
397,0,5,0.410000,and our relationship changed and
397,0,5,0.305000,i basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorved
397,0,5,0.233077,uh i i i don't know that i would've had children <chil> would've
397,0,5,0.275714,would've had children with her but i
397,0,5,0.241429,i wasn't very flexible in the process
397,0,5,0.210000,what to be flexible
397,0,5,0.133333,i don't know
397,0,5,0.268333,sometimes i am sometimes i'm not
397,0,5,0.910000,uh
397,0,5,0.226000,that'd been pulling my uh
397,0,5,0.285000,pulling my father out of off uh uh life support
397,0,5,0.220625,i just kept going back to something he said to me when i was uh younger
397,0,5,0.180000,that he would come back and haunt me and
397,0,5,0.232143,if i you know if i let him lay there lay there and suffer
397,0,5,0.174706,it took me a while to convince my other two brothers but  that's what we did
397,0,5,0.228571,something i could erase from my memory
397,0,5,0.297143,uh being locked up for a while
397,0,5,0.218889,i'd like to erase that from my memory <snort>
397,0,5,0.620000,it's just
397,0,5,0.312500,it's an everyday hell
397,0,5,0.334000,where there's very little humanity
397,0,5,0.445000,and uh
397,0,5,0.173000,you even do some things that you're not proud of
397,0,5,0.213793,i've never slept i've never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that  if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep
397,0,5,0.195714,so it's it's difficult <diffi> it's uh
397,0,5,0.217778,<snort> unless i'm really tired then you know <sneeze>
397,0,5,0.263333,i'm pretty much still the same
397,0,5,0.220000,i don't change
397,0,5,0.198571,so so i had friend <f> uh
397,0,5,0.231290,things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was uh
397,0,5,0.297778,runned over in a crosswalk and uh he's on
397,0,5,0.165385,he's on life support so i haven't been feeling too good about that
397,0,5,0.342500,it's it's affected me
397,0,5,0.214583,it wasn't like he was jaywalking or anything he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the break so
397,0,5,0.196667,and he's on uh life support at this point
397,0,5,0.331538,mm no not really only consistent thing about me is i'm very inconsistent
397,0,5,0.805000,uh no
397,0,5,0.410000,no
397,0,5,0.219167,but i've had moments where i felt i was i was depressed
397,0,5,0.151429,okay i was talking when you were talking so i didn't hear the question
397,0,5,0.576667,uh uh yesterday
397,0,5,0.283750,had a conversation with my fourteen year-old granddaughter
397,0,5,0.265625,i'm happy i have moments of happiness every day 'cause i i either speak to or
397,0,5,0.278889,text with uh my daughters and granddaughters every day
397,0,5,0.245000,even if
397,0,5,0.188000,we're upset with one another
397,0,5,0.154286,oh i have a lot of regrets
397,0,5,0.980000,uh
397,0,5,0.195000,i should've went to law school
397,0,5,0.274000,that's that's kinda something i thought yeah began to think about more in my lifetime
397,0,5,0.256111,i was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do <snort>
397,0,5,0.307619,uh <sigh> uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team
397,0,5,0.283333,had some tryouts things like that
397,0,5,0.242000,but they didn't pan out
397,0,5,0.202105,and as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer
397,0,5,0.188333,so i just did other things
397,0,5,0.226000,i don't think it'd make that much difference i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>
397,0,5,0.736000,um about myself uh <hums>
397,0,5,0.810000,uh
397,0,5,0.310000,i could be uh
397,0,5,0.215000,if i don't like you i could be very uh very difficult
397,0,5,0.166000,if i don't like you
397,0,5,0.191429,i'd very much like to change that
397,0,5,0.325714,it has in the past yeah <snort>
397,0,5,0.225263,well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you
397,0,5,0.233500,and i'm not real big on letting <let> letting people do that to me uh although my first wife when
397,0,5,0.337500,when she left me with the children <snort> she you know that it was my fault
397,0,5,0.180000,and i wasn't sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass
397,0,5,0.323333,and and uh
397,0,5,0.286429,but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part <snort>
397,0,5,0.387333,<sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody
397,0,5,0.390000,uh
397,0,5,0.174444,whether i agree with you or disagree with you
397,0,5,0.640000,uh
397,0,5,0.345000,uh i've taught myself to uh
397,0,5,0.326250,control anger that i that i have uh
397,0,5,0.255517,and uh if if i've called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it it's that's not something that i do uh
397,0,5,0.630000,casually
397,0,5,0.367143,<snort> uh oh okay well i i played eighteen holes of golf with a
397,0,5,0.278182,with an old dear friend and we got caught up and

397,0,5,0.246364,we four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner
397,0,5,0.313333,met his new wife uh had a good time
397,0,5,0.168889,a lot of a lot of memories came back

397,0,5,0.200833,i don't know if all kids are like that i i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology but
397,0,5,0.240000,but that's me mainly 'cause i don't
397,0,5,0.225000,but if my grandkids are any any uh sampling of it i think they're good i think they're pretty good
397,0,5,0.733333,<snort> uh <sigh>
397,0,5,0.313333,raising my girls
397,0,5,0.254444,basically by myself with the help of my mother
397,0,5,0.180000,i think that's the uh most proud of
397,0,5,0.360000,or

445,0,1,0.403333,and the ocean
445,0,1,0.500000,it's overcrowded
445,0,1,0.900000,overpriced
445,0,1,0.493333,and somewhat dirty
445,0,1,0.335000,i have
445,0,1,0.304412,well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures
445,0,1,0.344444,i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer
445,0,1,0.438571,and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands
445,0,1,0.730000,korea japan
445,0,1,0.327500,and the caribbean islands
445,0,1,0.360000,um
445,0,1,0.393000,being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane
445,0,1,0.265000,and traveling in a snow storm
445,0,1,0.675000,and surviving
445,0,1,0.276923,like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived
445,0,1,0.542500,the arts and business
445,0,1,0.240000,i don't know i was attracted to the arts at a young age
445,0,1,0.298333,and business went along with it
445,0,1,0.520000,yes
445,0,1,0.500000,yes
445,0,1,0.404000,to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life
445,0,1,0.475000,more outgoing
445,0,1,0.460000,um
445,0,1,0.298182,i always feel <fee> i feel very confident with my thoughts
445,0,1,0.262727,and i like people to know what i have to say
445,0,1,0.340000,um i listen to music
445,0,1,0.333333,and i sit with my girlfriend
445,0,1,0.248889,and she calms me down when i'm stressed out
445,0,1,0.230000,i could work on that i'm not very good at that
445,0,1,0.355000,last night
445,0,1,0.350000,with my girlfriend
445,0,1,0.311250,she was asking my advice on something and
445,0,1,0.274737,as i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i was not angry
445,0,1,0.250870,but i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didn't really wanna help i just wanted to relax
445,0,1,0.986667,<laughter> i agree
445,0,1,0.530000,um
445,0,1,0.315833,sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset
445,0,1,0.260625,and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings
445,0,1,0.249565,and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal
445,0,1,0.258889,it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier
445,0,1,0.260909,well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of c_o_p_d and then it turned into lung cancer
445,0,1,0.353750,i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful
445,0,1,0.266842,and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth
445,0,1,0.214444,and i let her think that everything was okay
445,0,1,0.305000,it was
445,0,1,0.610000,uh
445,0,1,0.320000,my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline
445,0,1,0.265769,that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better
445,0,1,0.248750,oh i don't know i try to uh
445,0,1,0.477500,be grateful i'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives
445,0,1,0.257000,and not dwell on the negative things of my memory
445,0,1,0.277222,my girlfriend she's a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person
445,0,1,0.251429,she since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry
445,0,1,0.310000,to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positive zen-like man so
445,0,1,0.319333,what she's asking for is something that's gonna make me improve therefore i must capitulate
445,0,1,0.290000,it's very easy
445,0,1,0.296667,i sleep well
445,0,1,0.277000,sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but uh i go back to sleep
445,0,1,0.328000,that's unknown i don't know
445,0,1,0.293333,it just happens
445,0,1,0.414000,i've been feeling uh good
445,0,1,0.343846,eh the my reality is i've been hit with a lot of financial
445,0,1,0.350000,uh problems but i'm handling <ha> handling them well actually
445,0,1,0.275862,i've been looking at it as my girlfriend has told me that i need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now
445,0,1,0.360000,no
445,0,1,0.360000,no
445,0,1,0.510000,today
445,0,1,0.247500,when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm achieving each one one by one
445,0,1,0.292222,it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness
445,0,1,0.329412,my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend as that's something we enjoy to do
445,0,1,0.311667,healthy <hea> going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit
445,0,1,0.650000,uh
445,0,1,0.890000,probably
445,0,1,0.313750,as a strong-willed person with a big heart
445,0,1,0.328333,but has a short fuse and
445,0,1,0.365000,maybe complains about his own life too much
445,0,1,0.272800,i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side
445,0,1,0.226364,well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and then i felt it was the best thing i'd ever done
445,0,1,0.305000,so that and i would don't understand how anybody could could feel that way
445,0,1,0.248333,and i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that
445,0,1,0.232500,as it's my goal
445,0,1,0.295000,no nothing i regret
445,0,1,0.245000,i felt
445,0,1,0.345000,hmm ten or twenty years ago
445,0,1,0.236667,i don't know
445,0,1,1.015000,um <sigh>
445,0,1,0.324211,well everything i do i enjoy it's hard to to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed
445,0,1,0.347500,uh i don't know
445,0,1,0.224286,how to put one above the other
445,0,1,0.313750,when things don't go my way and finances xxx come down and i don't get jobs that i go for that i am qualified for but i feel i am not getting
445,0,1,0.346667,my fair chance
445,0,1,0.455000,at opportunity
445,0,1,0.316667,it's very frustrating
445,0,1,0.282857,i don't really feel guilty about things
445,0,1,0.281579,sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be i feel guilty about that i don't ever wanna be
445,0,1,0.382000,short with my girlfriend ever
445,0,1,0.417273,she wouldn't doesn't deserve somebody um using vulgar language or shouting
445,0,1,0.240000,or something so i don't wanna be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty
445,0,1,0.310800,my achievements of my abilities through my music and my other abilities that i have and of my hard work has paid off and uh
445,0,1,0.240000,i'm very proud of those
445,0,1,0.416667,okay thank you
445,0,1,0.570000,goodbye
440,1,19,1.040000,<sync>
440,1,19,0.410000,yes
440,1,19,0.237500,i'm okay thank you
440,1,19,0.273750,um i was born in east los angeles
440,1,19,0.600000,and
440,1,19,0.300000,yes
440,1,19,0.653333,um the freedom to explore outdoors
440,1,19,0.382500,and with different um
440,1,19,0.297778,weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat>
440,1,19,0.890000,temperature
440,1,19,0.528333,and climates to go skiing or
440,1,19,0.267500,to the beach maybe in the same day
440,1,19,0.146667,i like that
440,1,19,0.890000,um
440,1,19,0.813333,mm i think probably the overcrowding
440,1,19,0.515000,um and the smog
440,1,19,0.372857,mm not not frequently but i have
440,1,19,0.417273,meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures
440,1,19,0.456154,sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy
440,1,19,0.705000,and um
440,1,19,0.231429,that was my second time being there
440,1,19,0.890000,and
440,1,19,0.283333,i enjoyed it more this time
440,1,19,1.180000,because
440,1,19,0.284286,um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um
440,1,19,0.304000,and i was better prepared
440,1,19,0.750000,for
440,1,19,0.598333,italians and their culture i felt
440,1,19,0.276154,i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought
440,1,19,0.236667,for that trip
440,1,19,0.490000,um <clears throat>
440,1,19,0.380000,that would be
440,1,19,0.576364,um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house
440,1,19,0.295000,in the midst of
440,1,19,0.517778,acres and acres and acres of grapes was just
440,1,19,0.730000,magnificent
440,1,19,0.403333,um human development
440,1,19,0.322308,um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i
440,1,19,0.385000,started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant
440,1,19,0.297143,and um i went to a program
440,1,19,0.327778,in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant
440,1,19,0.354400,and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss
440,1,19,0.230625,i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly
440,1,19,0.441667,and um so the college offered
440,1,19,0.362000,human development as a major
440,1,19,0.476667,and i um
440,1,19,0.284118,just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired
440,1,19,0.376000,towards that particular major and
440,1,19,0.152000,and i'm happy with it
440,1,19,0.349167,um currently no i stay at home i have a little one
440,1,19,0.242308,uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work
440,1,19,0.700000,um
440,1,19,0.325000,in the meantime i design jewelry
440,1,19,0.212500,well i have three
440,1,19,0.335000,children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children
440,1,19,0.297500,seventeen and twenty three
440,1,19,0.340000,no
440,1,19,0.494000,um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional
440,1,19,0.266667,all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time
440,1,19,0.322500,for every age <laughter>
440,1,19,0.308462,and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages
440,1,19,0.230000,so
440,1,19,0.390833,um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages
440,1,19,0.291667,that's why it makes me crazy
440,1,19,0.305714,um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents
440,1,19,0.304000,it was just kinda like
440,1,19,0.267500,you know is she fed is she dressed
440,1,19,0.192727,she has a house i mean a roof over her head
440,1,19,0.269167,and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so
440,1,19,0.302353,it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of
440,1,19,0.327222,that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age
440,1,19,0.523333,every year month
440,1,19,0.406667,you know <clears throat> and um
440,1,19,0.224444,so i think it difference differs in that way
440,1,19,0.600000,tremendously
440,1,19,0.475000,very close
440,1,19,0.205000,<clears throat>
440,1,19,0.540000,outgoing
440,1,19,0.780000,mm
440,1,19,0.491111,i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited
440,1,19,0.300000,i
440,1,19,0.180000,feel a little
440,1,19,0.130000,you know
440,1,19,0.320000,confident to talk to people
440,1,19,0.356667,i probably talk
440,1,19,0.225000,more than i need to <laughter>
440,1,19,0.526000,um <clears throat> i bead
440,1,19,0.329231,i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax
440,1,19,0.366000,i'm pretty good i i
440,1,19,0.376000,well i think i um
440,1,19,0.310000,try not to
440,1,19,0.380000,not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are
440,1,19,0.316667,when i'm upset
440,1,19,0.300000,um which is not good
440,1,19,0.226316,'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out
440,1,19,0.535000,and um
440,1,19,0.265000,yeah that
440,1,19,0.252500,that's uh something i have to work on
440,1,19,0.387500,like exercising or something
440,1,19,0.362727,um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about
440,1,19,0.800000,um
440,1,19,0.352500,he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage
440,1,19,0.205000,on him
440,1,19,0.422222,uh really tired of talking about that same topic
440,1,19,0.810000,um
440,1,19,0.272500,well it came it spawned from <f> from
440,1,19,0.318621,a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for
440,1,19,0.440000,many things
440,1,19,0.427500,and um <clears throat>
440,1,19,0.245556,and so he took that information and came home
440,1,19,0.288667,and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me
440,1,19,0.455000,think about cheating and
440,1,19,0.300000,he knows that i've been resentful of him
440,1,19,0.259524,and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating
440,1,19,0.440000,<clears throat> and um <sigh>
440,1,19,0.367778,i we've had this conversation a lot of times
440,1,19,0.245000,and uh i mean not just that but
440,1,19,0.266250,i don't know just about cheating in general
440,1,19,0.287500,and um so i just said what i
440,1,19,0.401250,normally said normally say is that i haven't
440,1,19,0.780000,um
440,1,19,0.237500,cheated and that i
440,1,19,0.282222,did think about that when we were first together
440,1,19,0.206667,and uh but it was just a mere thought
440,1,19,0.930000,and
440,1,19,0.920000,um
440,1,19,0.248500,and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another
440,1,19,0.405000,and that just kinda
440,1,19,0.315455,<sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that
440,1,19,0.273846,and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again
440,1,19,0.245000,and why are we having this conversation <laughter>
440,1,19,0.231818,are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that
440,1,19,0.620000,that
440,1,19,0.525000,went into
440,1,19,0.575000,that um
440,1,19,0.321765,argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting
440,1,19,1.175000,um <sigh>
440,1,19,0.345000,not talking
440,1,19,0.383333,at all <laughter>
440,1,19,0.940000,um <sigh>
440,1,19,0.280000,mm
440,1,19,0.398333,pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled
440,1,19,0.258000,because i really don't like
440,1,19,0.271250,if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because
440,1,19,0.300000,um i was yelled at
440,1,19,0.315000,a lot
440,1,19,0.213333,and i just
440,1,19,0.301667,feel bad about that and i
440,1,19,0.350000,try really hard to not
440,1,19,0.341875,handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get
440,1,19,0.422000,and result in in yelling
440,1,19,0.190000,hmm
440,1,19,0.302857,that would probably be whether to keep
440,1,19,0.322500,a pregnancy or not
440,1,19,0.210000,yeah
440,1,19,0.443333,yeah i um
440,1,19,0.262500,i was just talking about it yesterday actually
440,1,19,1.040000,and um
440,1,19,0.414000,oh i was pregnant and
440,1,19,0.292143,i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married
440,1,19,0.475000,and but i just
440,1,19,0.272727,didn't think that i it was the right time for me
440,1,19,0.895000,and um
440,1,19,0.205000,i had
440,1,19,0.276000,pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy
440,1,19,0.254286,but i made the decision by myself
440,1,19,0.439091,and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant
440,1,19,0.289375,he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me
440,1,19,0.322857,and so that decision was quite hard
440,1,19,0.368571,because i felt obligated to do so
440,1,19,0.365000,and felt super guilty to not
440,1,19,0.260000,and
440,1,19,0.656667,<drops microphone> oops
440,1,19,0.415000,and uh
440,1,19,0.428000,this is on correctly um
440,1,19,0.232857,hang on this ear piece is falling
440,1,19,0.176667,there we go
440,1,19,0.317273,that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no
440,1,19,0.292727,i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make
440,1,19,0.349000,in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um
440,1,19,0.458571,the hospital should um unplug the life
440,1,19,0.385000,or um life support machine for my father
440,1,19,0.325000,or not
440,1,19,0.250000,that was the hardest decision
440,1,19,0.280000,um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that
440,1,19,0.394000,and to have been um
440,1,19,0.334444,to resort to the situation that he was in
440,1,19,0.414444,not capable of doing anything at all either speaking
440,1,19,0.496667,for himself um
440,1,19,0.396667,was beyond it
440,1,19,0.280000,who he was and i just couldn't see him
440,1,19,0.385000,like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told
440,1,19,0.903333,so i agreed
440,1,19,0.320000,to um resort that
440,1,19,0.430000,not
440,1,19,0.345000,hardly ever
440,1,19,0.070000,<laughter>
440,1,19,0.356250,too many things running on my mind um
440,1,19,0.762500,and pretty much um
440,1,19,0.298667,mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends
440,1,19,0.445000,uh even though i
440,1,19,0.310833,know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about
440,1,19,0.278636,uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time
440,1,19,0.480000,but um
440,1,19,0.284400,and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out
440,1,19,0.216667,but it's hard
440,1,19,0.465000,very stressed
440,1,19,0.403333,mm my son is is um
440,1,19,0.570000,has been
440,1,19,0.464286,uh in dealing with some legal issues
440,1,19,0.706000,and um currently is incarcerated
440,1,19,0.710000,and uh
440,1,19,0.200000,it's been really hard
440,1,19,0.355000,yes i've been probably very short
440,1,19,0.530000,moody irritable
440,1,19,0.298571,well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>
440,1,19,0.255000,my mind just goes from one
440,1,19,0.233571,point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there
440,1,19,0.486667,um you know
440,1,19,0.675000,it's interesting
440,1,19,0.805000,uh yeah
440,1,19,0.180000,no
440,1,19,0.370000,yes
440,1,19,0.267500,about three years ago
440,1,19,0.915000,um my
440,1,19,0.950000,um o_b_g
440,1,19,0.675000,suggested i
440,1,19,0.685000,i uh
440,1,19,0.656667,see a psychiatrist
440,1,19,0.410000,yes
440,1,19,0.575000,well um
440,1,19,0.440000,i've
440,1,19,0.359000,in the process of changing therapists so it's been about
440,1,19,0.287143,because the program that i was in
440,1,19,0.780000,um
440,1,19,0.410000,lost funding
440,1,19,0.396000,and i lost my therapist
440,1,19,0.251667,or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been
440,1,19,0.740000,about two months
440,1,19,0.360000,maybe three now
440,1,19,0.363636,and um but i did notice when i was in therapy
440,1,19,0.272000,um that it was just an intricate part of my
440,1,19,0.390000,my life my week to
440,1,19,0.410000,see my therapist
440,1,19,0.770000,um
440,1,19,0.270000,it really helped me
440,1,19,0.480000,cope
440,1,19,1.850000,um
440,1,19,0.331818,<sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um
440,1,19,0.292500,when he was released
440,1,19,0.545000,from um
440,1,19,0.310000,jail
440,1,19,1.520000,um
440,1,19,0.353750,a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning
440,1,19,0.560000,that i'll
440,1,19,0.325385,i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to
440,1,19,0.210000,do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know
440,1,19,0.273333,legally of course
440,1,19,0.780000,um
440,1,19,1.120000,outgoing
440,1,19,0.413636,um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her
440,1,19,0.680000,um
440,1,19,0.890000,and
440,1,19,0.720000,compassionate
440,1,19,0.780000,sensitive
440,1,19,0.400000,loyal
440,1,19,0.370000,mm
440,1,19,0.277000,all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>
440,1,19,0.320000,well yelling the yelling part was one
440,1,19,0.920000,um
440,1,19,0.248571,just <j> just the little things that
440,1,19,0.255000,used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself
440,1,19,0.266250,doing them and it bothers me a lot
440,1,19,0.440000,regarding what

440,1,19,0.270769,that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy
440,1,19,0.255500,or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and
440,1,19,0.317778,not in a relationship and still be happy and
440,1,19,0.290000,live life

363,0,0,0.366250,being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion
363,0,0,0.389118,and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great

363,0,0,0.151667,you know you live with that
363,0,0,0.451538,um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um

363,0,0,0.443333,independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs
363,0,0,0.294545,and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do
363,0,0,0.408400,and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so
363,0,0,0.275556,i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be
363,0,0,0.670000,mm
363,0,0,0.225000,i'm not
363,0,0,0.420000,well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm
363,0,0,0.334687,probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean
363,0,0,0.314583,when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um
363,0,0,0.303333,obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself
363,0,0,0.300000,oh sure you know i have um
363,0,0,0.283000,uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to
363,0,0,0.265185,yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me
363,0,0,0.342400,um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um
363,0,0,0.224839,if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it
363,0,0,0.695000,actually um
363,0,0,0.510000,my relaxation is um i'm currently um
363,0,0,0.356351,living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work
363,0,0,0.335556,take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know
363,0,0,0.405000,um i'm not um
363,0,0,0.306667,i'm not a
363,0,0,0.366750,short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned
363,0,0,0.260000,there's not there's not much to that
363,0,0,1.400000,um
363,0,0,0.322500,i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um
363,0,0,0.358571,being very difficult to work with um
363,0,0,0.306154,and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh
363,0,0,0.377895,they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because
363,0,0,0.258472,um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that
363,0,0,0.513333,it does <laughter>
363,0,0,0.385000,probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um
363,0,0,0.351190,it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and
363,0,0,0.308122,yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point
363,0,0,0.236667,or it would it would kill him you know
363,0,0,0.373947,um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i
363,0,0,0.279767,i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run
363,0,0,0.295000,it is
363,0,0,0.335000,it was
363,0,0,0.490000,um
363,0,0,0.381852,well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated
363,0,0,0.288947,and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together
363,0,0,0.357895,and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so
363,0,0,0.269231,she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old
363,0,0,0.240000,and
363,0,0,0.336000,and so she needs to
363,0,0,0.357619,uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh
363,0,0,0.280692,someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child
363,0,0,0.354211,probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage
363,0,0,0.456000,um as far as um
363,0,0,0.322593,the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife
363,0,0,0.447500,uh yeah i um
363,0,0,0.452857,got caught up in a situation where
363,0,0,0.344062,um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart
363,0,0,0.354762,and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so
363,0,0,0.197391,you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money
363,0,0,0.497000,and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship
363,0,0,0.314286,had to do with trust because um
363,0,0,0.245714,it it was devastating to my wife
363,0,0,0.249167,i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light
363,0,0,0.364000,um i felt very guilty
363,0,0,0.207857,and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life
363,0,0,0.332500,no not at all
363,0,0,0.400000,no not really no
363,0,0,0.289118,i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no
363,0,0,0.350000,no
363,0,0,0.190000,not at all
363,0,0,0.268750,no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um
363,0,0,0.267000,after i had my heart attack a few years ago
363,0,0,0.318200,um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before
363,0,0,0.271667,so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that
363,0,0,0.278571,the last time i felt really happy
363,0,0,0.800000,um
363,0,0,0.685000,probably when
363,0,0,0.403636,i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack
363,0,0,0.510000,and um
363,0,0,0.449412,he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that
363,0,0,0.263077,he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue
363,0,0,0.297000,no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack
363,0,0,0.318750,and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications
363,0,0,0.332500,well i guess number one thing is uh
363,0,0,0.800000,my physical being itself
363,0,0,0.250769,i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight
363,0,0,0.580000,um
363,0,0,0.375000,just in general just be more healthier physically
363,0,0,0.410000,and as far as mentally um just not
363,0,0,0.294000,go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish
363,0,0,0.190000,just one day at a time
363,0,0,0.334000,you know i just uh
363,0,0,0.297500,try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis
363,0,0,0.322258,i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself
363,0,0,0.243333,i do things to help myself
363,0,0,0.310000,well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage
363,0,0,0.367000,uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and
363,0,0,0.358056,and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but
363,0,0,0.650000,um
363,0,0,0.258824,at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done
363,0,0,0.312222,so i don't focus too much on the past
363,0,0,0.199048,i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day
363,0,0,0.355385,what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing
363,0,0,0.312308,to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed
363,0,0,0.302727,um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh
363,0,0,0.367895,i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um
363,0,0,2.810000,scrubbed_entry
363,0,0,0.321538,you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately
363,0,0,0.860000,probably
363,0,0,0.337500,the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that
363,0,0,0.318600,um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that
363,0,0,0.380909,um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive
363,0,0,0.342857,uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy
363,0,0,0.311929,and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh
363,0,0,0.242500,just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night
363,0,0,0.186000,one day at a time
363,0,0,0.337143,it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where
363,0,0,0.379091,you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines
363,0,0,0.348000,and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore
363,0,0,0.275000,um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably
363,0,0,1.155000,easygoing generous
363,0,0,0.328571,um a nice person to be around
363,0,0,0.485000,and um
363,0,0,0.205000,you know
363,0,0,0.313571,they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues
363,0,0,0.365714,uh related to the gambling and the
363,0,0,0.290526,my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know
363,0,0,0.495000,well my ideal weekend starts off usually um
363,0,0,0.248333,after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock
363,0,0,0.403182,um i go to a local park and uh it's about
363,0,0,0.246515,this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning
363,0,0,0.530000,um
363,0,0,0.319375,get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um
363,0,0,0.257500,you know go home
363,0,0,0.318750,um work in the yard a few hours
363,0,0,0.301429,take a shower and relax and then
363,0,0,0.242424,just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk
363,0,0,0.238000,work out in the yard
363,0,0,0.484000,watch t_v whatever just relax
363,0,0,0.225714,that's how a weekend goes for me

468,0,4,0.210000,i don't like the congestion of people here
468,0,4,0.602500,and i don't like
468,0,4,0.271818,the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas
468,0,4,0.317143,uh i've been trying to actually um
468,0,4,0.320000,last year was the summer of
468,0,4,0.287273,really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um
468,0,4,0.245909,we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip
468,0,4,0.244444,down the south see some of the southern states
468,0,4,0.286154,but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and
468,0,4,0.242857,been to various states here and there
468,0,4,0.156000,trying to get out there
468,0,4,0.351538,i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing>
468,0,4,0.361111,different foods that are native to that local area
468,0,4,1.230000,and
468,0,4,0.256429,it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know
468,0,4,0.268000,this planet we call earth
468,0,4,0.311333,um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh
468,0,4,0.267500,it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle
468,0,4,0.237059,and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and
468,0,4,0.309333,headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just
468,0,4,0.571667,very lush beautiful trees the uh
468,0,4,0.293636,the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around
468,0,4,0.590000,yeah
468,0,4,0.515455,<deep breath> <sigh> one of my most memorable <sigh> memorable experiences
468,0,4,0.347500,was probably the uh
468,0,4,0.240000,the trip we took to colorado last summer
468,0,4,0.235556,and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver
468,0,4,0.212857,and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um
468,0,4,0.240000,just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area
468,0,4,0.285200,and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we
468,0,4,0.216000,even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and
468,0,4,0.380000,see the
468,0,4,0.230714,the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and
468,0,4,0.279500,it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do
468,0,4,0.660000,yeah
468,0,4,0.286667,i uh i studied business management
468,0,4,0.470000,and uh economics right now
468,0,4,0.372000,um i've always wanted to
468,0,4,0.261000,own my own business and i figured management be a
468,0,4,0.236190,a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to
468,0,4,0.257500,see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um
468,0,4,0.275000,and then economics is just to
468,0,4,0.261579,just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and
468,0,4,0.247407,start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics
468,0,4,0.268333,yeah i'm really stoked it was
468,0,4,0.237000,one of the best decisions probably of my my life
468,0,4,0.380000,yeah
468,0,4,0.261667,i consider myself more outgoing i'm
468,0,4,0.228462,i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff
468,0,4,0.247000,<sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking
468,0,4,0.237273,i like to go um working out at the gym but
468,0,4,0.223125,i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just
468,0,4,0.210000,just puts me at ease
468,0,4,0.220476,from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there
468,0,4,0.425000,i uh
468,0,4,0.231379,it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay
468,0,4,0.358333,angry and hold grudges just 'cause
468,0,4,0.201000,there's no need to life's too short for all that
468,0,4,0.820000,um
468,0,4,0.172500,see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody
468,0,4,0.227500,i have no idea
468,0,4,0.477500,probably when my uh
468,0,4,0.208889,my brother and my girlfriend got in a little
468,0,4,0.495000,little argument
468,0,4,0.326923,uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um
468,0,4,0.165714,i wish i would've just handled it
468,0,4,0.249714,right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and
468,0,4,0.248261,told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution
468,0,4,0.205000,but now it's just
468,0,4,0.610000,awkward
468,0,4,0.243333,yeah it does
468,0,4,0.283750,the hardest decision i've ever had to make
468,0,4,0.285000,man that's a toughy
468,0,4,0.201429,i don't think i've had too many
468,0,4,0.222143,tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um
468,0,4,0.800000,maybe
468,0,4,0.251429,not moving to colorado for my undergrad
468,0,4,0.335000,two three years ago
468,0,4,0.186364,was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if
468,0,4,0.223571,but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that
468,0,4,0.194286,was really that hard of a decision
468,0,4,0.230000,i don't really feel guilty about anything
468,0,4,0.213000,pretty good person i think and for the most part
468,0,4,0.186000,i couldn't think of anything
468,0,4,0.267273,something i could wish i could erase from my memory um
468,0,4,0.315000,nothing really to be honest i
468,0,4,0.257500,i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part
468,0,4,0.222500,i know that's kinda
468,0,4,0.230769,weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and
468,0,4,0.305000,i'm happy
468,0,4,0.410000,yeah
468,0,4,0.209524,uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's
468,0,4,0.284737,it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month
468,0,4,0.197143,but uh when i see 'em it's
468,0,4,0.178824,it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and
468,0,4,0.225556,it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh
468,0,4,0.207500,it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult
468,0,4,0.290000,mm
468,0,4,0.397500,my girlfriend's family uh
468,0,4,0.190476,they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction
468,0,4,0.202500,just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about
468,0,4,0.337500,really thinking long term
468,0,4,0.271250,and uh just seeing them <th> them and
468,0,4,0.346000,what their family does and
468,0,4,0.253000,how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to
468,0,4,0.208000,and they've been very successful they own their own uh
468,0,4,0.443333,accounting practice and
468,0,4,0.341111,seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life
468,0,4,0.680000,yeah
468,0,4,0.168462,it's pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and
468,0,4,0.222000,wake up in the morning
468,0,4,0.325000,i'm tired sometimes i'm
468,0,4,0.235556,could sense that i'm a little drained and uh
468,0,4,0.265000,maybe get a little groggy here and there
468,0,4,0.186667,and that's it
468,0,4,0.207778,feeling pretty good for the most part a little
468,0,4,0.258889,stressed out just 'cause finals are uh next week
468,0,4,0.237826,and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks
468,0,4,0.440000,and um
468,0,4,0.177200,for the most part that's that's the only thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited i'm looking forward to
468,0,4,0.231333,going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to
468,0,4,0.167059,see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and
468,0,4,0.171905,what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while
468,0,4,0.630000,yeah
468,0,4,0.301429,i have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
468,0,4,0.347143,i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>
468,0,4,0.235926,the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday
468,0,4,0.254348,and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through
468,0,4,0.363333,the nursing program for five and
468,0,4,0.235000,it's just
468,0,4,0.179000,seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her
468,0,4,0.400000,yeah
468,0,4,0.626667,probably outgoing friendly
468,0,4,0.382500,positive vibes all around

468,0,4,0.341429,no not really for the most part
468,0,4,0.280000,no not really
468,0,4,0.201176,just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just
468,0,4,0.217222,maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated
468,0,4,0.265000,but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined
468,0,4,0.308000,right now and that's not
468,0,4,0.190000,i'm not going that way right now so
468,0,4,0.300000,mhm
468,0,4,0.290000,no biggie
468,0,4,0.780000,<sigh>
468,0,4,0.437500,oh man i couldn't

468,0,4,0.225000,i went caving two weeks ago
468,0,4,0.208333,that was a lot of fun
468,0,4,0.243333,uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a
468,0,4,0.260811,for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh
468,0,4,0.303333,sequoia and just
468,0,4,0.277647,me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes
468,0,4,0.241667,it was a lot of fun
468,0,4,0.375000,that was
468,0,4,0.420000,yeah
468,0,4,0.287143,ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school
468,0,4,0.264286,a little less on the social aspects
468,0,4,0.385000,and uh
468,0,4,0.242857,kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya

468,0,4,0.220000,really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want
468,0,4,0.440000,and uh

331,0,8,0.233000,um to be on a t_v show an actor 
331,0,8,0.323333,it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh

331,0,8,0.290000,no
331,0,8,0.250000,yes 
331,0,8,0.423333,uh about four years ago 
331,0,8,0.274375,um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft
331,0,8,0.284138,and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving
331,0,8,0.186667,um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did   
331,0,8,0.153333,thank you 
331,0,8,0.377778,um okay i'm panicky about the job situation 
331,0,8,0.258000,um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now 
331,0,8,0.333571,so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation 
331,0,8,0.150000,yeah 
331,0,8,0.215000,um 
331,0,8,0.265000,yeah i mean 
331,0,8,0.309524,well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing 
331,0,8,0.163793,yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink  
331,0,8,0.353182,um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself
331,0,8,0.223462,now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving 
331,0,8,0.310556,uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um
331,0,8,0.211538,they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would 
331,0,8,0.266667,make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin 
331,0,8,0.181176,just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  
331,0,8,0.267500,um not really 
331,0,8,0.297353,always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i
331,0,8,0.266250,eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed
331,0,8,0.285000,i do
331,0,8,0.260000,at some point i've had
331,0,8,0.229000,some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists 
331,0,8,0.212500,um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me
331,0,8,0.226875,and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  
331,0,8,0.275806,and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
331,0,8,0.410000,um
331,0,8,0.201111,well i'm not going to therapy now but 
331,0,8,0.232500,the therapy that i had before um 
331,0,8,0.281176,was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication
331,0,8,0.238571,um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better 
331,0,8,0.443333,um i just
331,0,8,0.360000,i wasn't getting the right therapists recently
331,0,8,0.280500,so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so 
331,0,8,0.294000,mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know 
331,0,8,0.350000,um 
331,0,8,0.184444,i can't really think of anything right now 
331,0,8,0.315000,um 
331,0,8,0.200000,it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy 
331,0,8,0.526667,thank you <sniffle>
331,0,8,0.365000,um 
331,0,8,0.176667,okay when i was a kid
331,0,8,0.225000,um 
331,0,8,0.248947,i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it 
331,0,8,0.314444,so then a little while later my father 
331,0,8,0.199259,came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them 
331,0,8,0.191429,so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  
331,0,8,0.229333,oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  
331,0,8,0.192500,yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so 
331,0,8,0.460000,um
331,0,8,0.278889,just the way that i've treated people before when
331,0,8,0.240909,i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people
331,0,8,0.242059,when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so 
331,0,8,0.220889,so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable 
331,0,8,0.391111,get in a career that is really stable 
331,0,8,0.243333,like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney
331,0,8,0.335000,something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so
331,0,8,0.190857,you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things 
331,0,8,0.285000,um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work 
331,0,8,0.292857,uh when i'm helping other people 
331,0,8,0.242000,uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood

457,0,3,0.328333,infrequently like once every couple years
457,0,3,0.468750,uh the weather exists so it's more extreme
457,0,3,0.505000,and then  it's
457,0,3,0.270000,rather less
457,0,3,0.650000,exciting
457,0,3,0.237500,a lot less colorful
457,0,3,0.612000,uh winter in minnesota <laughter>
457,0,3,0.520000,uh it took approximately
457,0,3,0.381667,the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh
457,0,3,0.198571,the lights took care of the rest
457,0,3,0.770000,uh
457,0,3,0.348000,i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh
457,0,3,0.258846,have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love
457,0,3,0.215000,the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here
457,0,3,0.343333,oh you know
457,0,3,0.480000,the traffic <sigh>
457,0,3,0.526667,the exceedingly high cost of living

457,0,3,0.517500,uh i like not
457,0,3,0.301250,knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to
457,0,3,0.554000,uh deal with people to
457,0,3,0.304545,deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to
457,0,3,0.730000,uh
457,0,3,0.346000,last year i got to
457,0,3,0.210000,hang out in san marcos for a little bit
457,0,3,0.235714,after i split up with my ex
457,0,3,0.345000,and then
457,0,3,0.245833,after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles
457,0,3,0.580000,<laughter>

457,0,3,0.466667,national news and
457,0,3,0.243333,he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group
457,0,3,0.335000,riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't
457,0,3,0.234242,bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday
457,0,3,0.280000,but
457,0,3,0.215000,our group of friends
457,0,3,0.337143,is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else
457,0,3,1.590000,<laughter>
457,0,3,0.276667,i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles
457,0,3,0.530000,um
457,0,3,0.265000,<clears throat>
457,0,3,0.383750,once i found the right group of friends
457,0,3,0.312500,it was easy to be social it it
457,0,3,0.458750,drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing
457,0,3,0.370000,bombastic for the first time and it stuck
457,0,3,0.590000,um
457,0,3,0.273500,if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out
457,0,3,0.404286,i i do all sorts of stuff
457,0,3,0.450000,it um
457,0,3,0.212143,usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project

457,0,3,6.610000,scrubbed_entry
457,0,3,0.500000,um
457,0,3,0.351667,<laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me
457,0,3,0.360000,and i mostly failed
457,0,3,0.860000,uh
457,0,3,0.263333,hard on him
457,0,3,0.378571,i mostly uh mostly got by with
457,0,3,0.190000,a couple of scrapes on my ego
457,0,3,0.760000,uh
457,0,3,0.460000,when 
457,0,3,0.258889,when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of
457,0,3,0.380000,having my <sigh>
457,0,3,0.353333,verbal gloves up i managed to
457,0,3,0.213000,take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was
457,0,3,0.282000,not my most graceful moment
457,0,3,1.070000,uh
457,0,3,0.253750,i feel guilty about lots of stuff um
457,0,3,0.237000,i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else
457,0,3,0.230870,'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy
457,0,3,0.186923,i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was
457,0,3,0.322857,uh made a lot of hard decisions
457,0,3,0.563333,i guess <sigh>
457,0,3,0.233636,it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff
457,0,3,0.280000,but
457,0,3,0.193846,it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so
457,0,3,0.230000,it's a tricky question madam
457,0,3,0.385000,uh oh you know broken collarbone
457,0,3,0.228125,severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time

457,0,3,0.650000,uh
457,0,3,0.370000,but
457,0,3,0.235600,since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce
457,0,3,0.760000,uh
457,0,3,0.246667,jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately
457,0,3,0.414000,she is a magical creature
457,0,3,0.680000,uh
457,0,3,0.363333,well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful
457,0,3,0.266000,there's the part where she
457,0,3,0.725000,manages to
457,0,3,0.356667,hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she
457,0,3,0.291875,actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part
457,0,3,0.560000,where
457,0,3,0.365000,she is a hundred percent kind and caring
457,0,3,0.226667,all the time
457,0,3,0.224286,all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that
457,0,3,0.297500,she does this all
457,0,3,0.472000,without wanting anything in return
457,0,3,0.247500,i don't know that's
457,0,3,0.750000,<sigh> smitten <laughter>

457,0,3,0.590000,uh
457,0,3,0.286000,the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits
457,0,3,0.370000,so
457,0,3,0.226000,i i get to sleep
457,0,3,0.240000,poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter
457,0,3,0.297419,<deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life
457,0,3,0.295455,uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire
457,0,3,0.390000,um mm
457,0,3,0.760000,because
457,0,3,0.400000,the universe
457,0,3,0.270000,in its
457,0,3,0.760000,infinite
457,0,3,0.445000,uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor

457,0,3,0.780000,reality
457,0,3,0.365000,of magic
457,0,3,0.225000,in the arthur c clark sense

457,0,3,0.780000,yeah
457,0,3,0.392000,uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate
457,0,3,0.377000,and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time
457,0,3,0.232727,if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set
457,0,3,0.210714,mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no
457,0,3,0.189474,uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago

403,0,0,0.224000,and try to do it there and  you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but
403,0,0,0.298333,it was tough deciding like should i leave l_a and make this
403,0,0,0.289375,jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing
403,0,0,0.284231,i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was studying communications

403,0,0,0.368571,really grinding in more than i was
403,0,0,0.253889,i mean it's kinda hard 'cause you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and
403,0,0,0.318333,see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else
403,0,0,0.320000,no
403,0,0,0.490000,no
403,0,0,0.456316,i mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone i know dies

403,0,0,0.650000,<laughter>

403,0,0,0.338818,straight a's one of the highest grades in the class so
403,0,0,0.296818,people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or
403,0,0,0.420667,stuff like that
403,0,0,0.440000,<laughter>

428,0,0,0.295000,at school
428,0,0,0.130000,<clears throat>
428,0,0,0.144444,i don't even know what it what is that

428,0,0,0.147000,well first of all i don't even have a job
428,0,0,0.175556,so i guess to change i get a job
428,0,0,0.195455,nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that
428,0,0,0.175000,<clears throat>

428,0,0,0.320000,so
428,0,0,0.210000,<clears throat>
428,0,0,0.251538,probably that i was like i was able to help my mom throughout
428,0,0,0.235385,because she was going through a really hard time my mom and um
428,0,0,0.289286,for almost nine years 'cause she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent
428,0,0,0.740000,so i
428,0,0,0.199286,i'm proud that i was able to help her even though i could only
428,0,0,0.466667,give so little
428,0,0,0.230526,but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed and
428,0,0,0.570000,um
428,0,0,0.213846,being around my family music music always puts me in a good mood

471,0,0,0.308000,i'm doing well thank you
471,0,0,0.528000,from los <l> los angeles
471,0,0,0.584000,mm sports outdoor sports mainly
471,0,0,0.662857,surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing
471,0,0,0.830000,traffic
471,0,0,0.780000,yes
471,0,0,0.806667,experiencing different cultures
471,0,0,0.491250,uh well uh i love going to mexico
471,0,0,0.455652,and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but
471,0,0,0.543333,uh the uh the level of
471,0,0,0.401579,of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds
471,0,0,0.376667,traveling you mean
471,0,0,0.690000,uh
471,0,0,0.390556,i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua
471,0,0,0.315556,and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes
471,0,0,0.311765,and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible
471,0,0,0.680000,uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place
471,0,0,0.463333,i studied biology
471,0,0,0.346800,uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also
471,0,0,0.316667,not at all i'm working in
471,0,0,0.410000,areas of business now
471,0,0,0.330000,yes i am
471,0,0,0.382222,my dream job would be to be a missionary
471,0,0,0.390000,yes
471,0,0,0.385789,my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very
471,0,0,0.362353,generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily
471,0,0,0.310244,but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket
471,0,0,0.390000,i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that
471,0,0,0.595000,i exercise
471,0,0,0.507500,i think i'm pretty good at it uh
471,0,0,0.256250,uh i think i'm pretty effective at it
471,0,0,0.327000,it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend
471,0,0,0.541111,and it was about her uh lack of consideration
471,0,0,0.700000,um
471,0,0,0.390000,i felt frustrated
471,0,0,0.750000,hmm
471,0,0,0.416667,a situation which
471,0,0,0.491429,i wished i could handle differently um
471,0,0,0.384348,i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh
471,0,0,0.394643,be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior
471,0,0,0.288000,i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that
471,0,0,0.320000,is so wrong
471,0,0,0.280000,and so
471,0,0,0.362778,in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my
471,0,0,0.375000,displeasure with someone's actions right away and that
471,0,0,0.431429,uh takes care of the anger immediately
471,0,0,0.336154,yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think
471,0,0,0.304375,eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end
471,0,0,0.573333,uh it diffuses trouble rather than
471,0,0,0.440000,prolongs or protracts the trouble
471,0,0,0.442222,uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued
471,0,0,0.454000,uh at length for many
471,0,0,0.485625,months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to
471,0,0,0.334615,i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh
471,0,0,0.590000,uh difficult period
471,0,0,0.243333,in my life
471,0,0,0.488421,mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their
471,0,0,0.585000,uh betrayals uh but now i realize that
471,0,0,0.365000,keeping those memories make me who i am today and
471,0,0,0.352222,and dealing with them defines who i am today
471,0,0,0.379474,uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that
471,0,0,0.329000,um even though my father was somewhat of a uh
471,0,0,1.125000,hard-handed uh
471,0,0,0.468571,and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died
471,0,0,0.315000,and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother
471,0,0,0.460000,but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect
471,0,0,0.436667,me also just
471,0,0,0.437500,just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil
471,0,0,0.463333,uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um
471,0,0,0.550000,he's clinically depressed
471,0,0,0.468000,and he has suicidal tendencies
471,0,0,0.427778,and uh he's not working he's very highly educated
471,0,0,0.356667,and he uh well he doesn't talk to me
471,0,0,0.485556,and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family
471,0,0,0.430000,yes
471,0,0,0.325000,you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model
471,0,0,0.472500,he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest
471,0,0,0.620000,and kind
471,0,0,0.335789,uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers
471,0,0,0.342500,eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two
471,0,0,0.346667,and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago
471,0,0,0.440000,um
471,0,0,0.541818,xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress
471,0,0,0.401250,i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay
471,0,0,0.548333,that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future
471,0,0,0.370000,about whether
471,0,0,0.301667,i will survive this or not
471,0,0,0.385000,not really
471,0,0,0.600000,no
471,0,0,0.580000,never
471,0,0,0.570000,never
471,0,0,0.557143,oh i was either surfing or snowboarding
471,0,0,0.427619,or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion
471,0,0,0.780000,funny
471,0,0,0.890000,jovial
471,0,0,1.127000,uh uh intelligent a perfectionist
471,0,0,0.442727,hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um
471,0,0,1.100000,maybe
471,0,0,0.778333,uh is to submerge my uh
471,0,0,0.770000,hedonistic self
471,0,0,0.366667,i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um
471,0,0,0.915000,uh deferrer of gratification
471,0,0,0.830000,he
471,0,0,0.260000,put
471,0,0,0.296667,now behind him and he put what will be in the future
471,0,0,0.289091,in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was
471,0,0,0.427500,whereas i am looking always for the present
471,0,0,0.370000,um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to
471,0,0,0.367727,uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away
471,0,0,0.448000,<deep breath> it would be
471,0,0,0.690000,my ex-boss
471,0,0,0.270000,and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using
471,0,0,0.298261,uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way
471,0,0,0.320000,and he continued to use more profanity
471,0,0,1.145000,until uh
471,0,0,0.339091,i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred
471,0,0,0.213333,a year and a half ago
471,0,0,0.710000,mhm
471,0,0,0.422308,anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids
471,0,0,0.528182,sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that
471,0,0,0.391000,that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had
471,0,0,0.407692,and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because
471,0,0,0.360870,that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness
471,0,0,0.252222,because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not
471,0,0,0.251667,we do not have the highest
471,0,0,0.358125,uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree
471,0,0,0.690000,mm
471,0,0,0.392857,that's a good one i would say
471,0,0,0.273043,<laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that

319,1,13,0.325000,for me no there isn't one
319,1,13,0.470000,mm
319,1,13,0.434286,i'm uh sort of unemployed right now
319,1,13,0.302500,<sigh> so am i
319,1,13,0.480000,<cough>

319,1,13,0.205000,that's it
319,1,13,0.920000,mm
319,1,13,0.378571,um i try to remove myself from that situation that's annoying me <sniffle> 
319,1,13,0.357143,i've gotten better over the years um

319,1,13,0.326667,but you know it was challenging
319,1,13,0.321667,um i would say seeing your children grow up to be successful
319,1,13,0.737500,and exceeding your expectations
319,1,13,0.247778,you worry all the time you worry for 'em

319,1,13,0.373333,always tired and
319,1,13,0.386667,not excited about things anymore and

319,1,13,0.184000,i'll leave it at that
319,1,13,0.540000,hmm
319,1,13,0.281250,well i still like sports you know and
319,1,13,0.363750,um watching a good game or something is
319,1,13,0.241765,usually puts me in a good mood particularly if my team wins you know i like u_s_c
319,1,13,0.415000,um i have a nephew that's um freshman football player at u_s_c
319,1,13,0.352500,and uh i've been a trojan football fan for forty years so

319,1,13,0.790000,straightforward
319,1,13,0.221538,that's a good question i don't know you would have to ask her
319,1,13,0.370000,definitely my mother
319,1,13,0.316154,but she's deceased now she's been deceased ten years but she was definitely
319,1,13,0.474000,positive influence my entire life
319,1,13,0.324545,no i have many regrets too many to name and number
319,1,13,0.307826,but um you know it's you know you have the the benefit of hindsight and yeah i have a lot of regrets 
319,1,13,0.550000,hmm
319,1,13,0.238889,to listen to the older people in my life
319,1,13,0.262500,the people who cared about me the people who only interest was to guide me in the right direction 
319,1,13,0.294000,like i said my kids i'm very proud of 'em
319,1,13,0.403333,sure my pleasure
319,1,13,0.340000,bye
307,0,4,0.810000,<laughter>
307,0,4,0.925000,um moscow
307,0,4,0.306250,um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college
307,0,4,0.302550, uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though
307,0,4,0.324762,it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between
307,0,4,0.292639,the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while
307,0,4,0.348182,one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist
307,0,4,0.371643,it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um
307,0,4,0.347500,i guess pretty close
307,0,4,0.294000,right now we're kinda distant
307,0,4,0.337500,oh about the distant
307,0,4,0.304176,okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks
307,0,4,0.316769,'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room
307,0,4,0.361333,and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of
307,0,4,0.257615,we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move 
307,0,4,0.464000,it's okay it'll get better
307,0,4,0.442400,it depends with whom 
307,0,4,0.870000,i'm
307,0,4,0.280833,dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good
307,0,4,0.326000,but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger
307,0,4,0.275308,oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]
307,0,4,1.020000,yeah
307,0,4,0.413333,uh probably my best friend nicole
307,0,4,0.420778,she's probably been we've been best friends for like
307,0,4,0.276158,god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah
307,0,4,0.740000,um
307,0,4,0.650000,of
307,0,4,0.553000,of what 
307,0,4,0.397500,uh my friend nicole
307,0,4,0.311818,um we met in french class freshman year of high school
307,0,4,0.308239,we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then
307,0,4,0.950000,mhm
307,0,4,0.690000,um
307,0,4,0.425083,uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking
307,0,4,0.471733,staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography
307,0,4,0.630000,um
307,0,4,0.327143,just hanging out with friends i guess
307,0,4,0.730000,whatever
307,0,4,0.670000,uh
307,0,4,0.312222,it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um
307,0,4,0.316667,those kinds of
307,0,4,0.471429,things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things
307,0,4,0.233750, i don't really discuss that with them
307,0,4,0.322000,so i guess superficially close
307,0,4,0.250000,but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
307,0,4,0.810000,mhm
307,0,4,0.593429,uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again
307,0,4,0.745778,i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant
307,0,4,1.450000,and
307,0,4,1.480000,uh
307,0,4,0.385867,conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um
307,0,4,0.269889,what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]
307,0,4,0.426250,but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
307,0,4,1.070000,uh yesterday
307,0,4,0.374500,and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money 
307,0,4,0.563333,and so and
307,0,4,0.299545,so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
307,0,4,0.242292,and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
307,0,4,0.387500,about other people or about myself or angry
307,0,4,1.510000,xxxx [laughter]
307,0,4,3.070000,um
307,0,4,0.250385,angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often
307,0,4,0.530000,dang it
307,0,4,0.286923,that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me
307,0,4,0.262500,um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring
307,0,4,0.257333,so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um
307,0,4,0.380250, my dream job
307,0,4,0.260364,i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end
307,0,4,0.268571,i guess it's something that i realized
307,0,4,0.365000,i like to see
307,0,4,0.292416,the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
307,0,4,0.295000,something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography
307,0,4,0.375000,i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something
307,0,4,0.390000,in that
307,0,4,0.390000,realm i guess
307,0,4,0.360600,i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to
307,0,4,0.382308,gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
307,0,4,0.315880,i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that
307,0,4,0.305765,i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
307,0,4,0.362450,um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot
307,0,4,0.312913,in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and
307,0,4,0.321303,see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to
307,0,4,0.440000,stir things up
307,0,4,1.001000,oh gosh okay um
307,0,4,0.317500,i'm trying to think
307,0,4,0.310000,one of my trips
307,0,4,0.284643,i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is
307,0,4,0.283567,one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
307,0,4,0.297189,i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
307,0,4,0.292409,i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
307,0,4,0.640000,um
307,0,4,0.286361,and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
307,0,4,0.282231,and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
307,0,4,0.266839,white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
307,0,4,0.320000,or something that's different too
307,0,4,0.780000,cool
307,0,4,1.040000,um
307,0,4,0.346000,pretty easy as long as i
307,0,4,0.329000,get well no i always sleep so easy
307,0,4,0.497048,oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
307,0,4,0.309550,i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of 
307,0,4,0.365000,energizing me so no it's not too bad
307,0,4,0.455000,that's good
307,0,4,0.297545,uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
307,0,4,0.850000,so
307,0,4,0.273235,it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
307,0,4,0.293019,yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
307,0,4,0.293447,so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
307,0,4,0.307375,barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
307,0,4,0.312500,when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
307,0,4,0.321722,yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
307,0,4,0.241903,but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
307,0,4,0.281786,all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
307,0,4,0.355944,uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
307,0,4,0.490000,yes
307,0,4,0.298500,but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because
307,0,4,0.291429,i'm just trying to find like what
307,0,4,0.371750,i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries
307,0,4,0.277526,so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
307,0,4,0.300000,it's all good
307,0,4,0.361222,uh no i don't think so but i mean
307,0,4,0.212000,i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can
307,0,4,0.420556,but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
307,0,4,0.690000,nope
307,0,4,0.800000,nope
307,0,4,0.450000,oh let's see
307,0,4,0.410846,uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail
307,0,4,0.242265,'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home
307,0,4,0.243533,so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it
307,0,4,0.550000,so
307,0,4,0.416667,ten years ago
307,0,4,0.292750,well that would've made me like twelve so
307,0,4,0.278125, [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act
307,0,4,0.301029,i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time
307,0,4,0.185391,and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it
307,0,4,0.291765,and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes 
307,0,4,0.363000,um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just
307,0,4,0.330000,expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder
307,0,4,0.244000,kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good
307,0,4,0.285714,i don't try to go above that
307,0,4,0.260000,if that makes any sense
307,0,4,0.349000,uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v
307,0,4,0.550000,[laughter]
307,0,4,0.276000,but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap
307,0,4,0.304763,or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done
307,0,4,0.380000,so
307,0,4,0.760000,[laughter]
307,0,4,0.472500,that's a tough question
307,0,4,0.473500,um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college
307,0,4,0.590000,um
307,0,4,0.387571,i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east
307,0,4,0.304000,and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year
307,0,4,0.282588,and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont
307,0,4,0.360000,and um
307,0,4,0.228256,i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in
307,0,4,0.189412,and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing 
307,0,4,0.460000,um
307,0,4,0.315214,but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like
307,0,4,0.330000,um
307,0,4,0.247412,just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well
307,0,4,0.223565,and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not
307,0,4,0.341732,um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy
307,0,4,0.273333,that's probably one
307,0,4,0.510000,yeah
307,0,4,0.265766,it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]
307,0,4,0.790000,yeah
307,0,4,0.630500,bubbly 
307,0,4,0.531500,fun 
307,0,4,0.410273,maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um
307,0,4,0.480000,probably 
307,0,4,0.512500, uh definitely friendly
307,0,4,0.523714,um and pretty like a positive person
307,0,4,0.690000,um
307,0,4,0.443333,but sometimes maybe a little bit
307,0,4,1.128500,aggressive but
307,0,4,0.287687,for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]
307,0,4,0.730000,huh 
307,0,4,0.615000,really happy
307,0,4,0.346167,oh when i was in mexico

401,0,9,0.469630,uh okay i oh i went to um france a few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very um
401,0,9,0.256296,it was it was actually really fun but very much like a story book as far as what i expected to see and what i actually saw
401,0,9,0.306923,like i what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but
401,0,9,0.299592,they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool <sniff> i like that
401,0,9,0.460000,<laughter>
401,0,9,0.485000,i'm borderline
401,0,9,0.337500,sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing it depends on who  and what the situation is
401,0,9,0.670000,<laughter>
401,0,9,0.565000,um music i turn on music i walk
401,0,9,0.290000,through the neighborhoods you know
401,0,9,0.331000,i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a
401,0,9,0.300000,um hot head at all
401,0,9,0.480000,hm
401,0,9,0.351667,oh it was an ex roommate
401,0,9,0.468889,and it was about my loyalty as a friend
401,0,9,0.481667,yeah um pretty much she um
401,0,9,0.357143,thought that because i wanted my rent
401,0,9,0.306000,which she agreed to pay
401,0,9,0.580000,that
401,0,9,0.286667,i was not
401,0,9,0.294286,being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and
401,0,9,0.302000,that wasn't going to happen
401,0,9,0.466667,so you know
401,0,9,0.320769,the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway
401,0,9,0.310000,even after she didn't pay me
401,0,9,0.285000,so that's a friend
401,0,9,0.285714,i could've kicked her out i didn't
401,0,9,0.278421,she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but
401,0,9,0.295000,you know
401,0,9,0.355000,could've um
401,0,9,0.254167,could've could've been a bad situation but there was an argument there
401,0,9,0.226000,a real a real one
401,0,9,0.325000,i wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when
401,0,9,0.401667,we agreed to be roommates temporarily
401,0,9,0.640000,and
401,0,9,0.476000,um gotten my money upfront
401,0,9,0.251429,that's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it
401,0,9,0.286000,no my mind told me to get the money upfront
401,0,9,0.323333,but i didn't
401,0,9,0.670000,so
401,0,9,0.580000,mm
401,0,9,0.666667,the hardest decision
401,0,9,0.850000,um
401,0,9,0.264286,i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like
401,0,9,0.508000,<tisk<> maybe um leaving home
401,0,9,0.275000,leaving home when i was years ago when i was like eighteen
401,0,9,0.460000,yeah
401,0,9,0.760000,um
401,0,9,0.270000,i felt like i was abandoning my family
401,0,9,0.325000,<laughter> that's what i felt <laughter> but um they encouraged me to go on and live my life
401,0,9,0.520000,mhm
401,0,9,0.516667,uh something that i could erase from my memory
401,0,9,1.490000,probably
401,0,9,0.475000,a friend
401,0,9,0.990000,who
401,0,9,0.423333,i was um
401,0,9,0.435000,uh dating
401,0,9,0.340455,i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother um was ill
401,0,9,0.296842,um it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so
401,0,9,0.290000,it's not that easy actually it's not that easy
401,0,9,0.180000,i'd have to

484,0,9,0.324000,i was born in oakland
484,0,9,0.358889,um <sigh> all the different areas of the city
484,0,9,0.267143,uh the different cultures that are here
484,0,9,0.706667,the traffic the
484,0,9,0.482000,um lack of public transportation
484,0,9,0.510000,and the superficiality
484,0,9,2.090000,<laughter>
484,0,9,0.313333,i i don't i would love to travel more
484,0,9,0.620000,um <sigh>
484,0,9,0.304444,being able to experience a different way of living
484,0,9,0.368182,um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and
484,0,9,0.430000,getting a different perspective
484,0,9,0.390000,um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months
484,0,9,0.320833,and i was in bahia which is in the north and um
484,0,9,0.398333,let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family
484,0,9,0.504167,um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um
484,0,9,0.320690,they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting
484,0,9,0.770000,um
484,0,9,0.400000,i think taking a bus by myself to
484,0,9,0.446250,a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go
484,0,9,0.270000,yeah
484,0,9,0.323333,right now i'm getting my master's in social work
484,0,9,1.990000,<laughter>
484,0,9,0.772308,dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and
484,0,9,0.533333,how to um
484,0,9,0.514286,how to intervene effectively with different cultures
484,0,9,0.443000,and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel
484,0,9,0.550000,um
484,0,9,0.440000,basically that those would be the main characteristics
484,0,9,0.423333,i think that's a false dichotomy
484,0,9,0.340370,but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone
484,0,9,0.323636,and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful
484,0,9,0.540000,<laughter>
484,0,9,0.482000,um i listen to music
484,0,9,0.348571,and just lay on my bed and
484,0,9,0.510000,um
484,0,9,0.304375,i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things
484,0,9,0.541538,also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise
484,0,9,0.327500,pretty good i don't get angry a lot
484,0,9,0.660000,um
484,0,9,0.419091,so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that
484,0,9,0.550000,hmm
484,0,9,1.600000,um
484,0,9,0.328333,mm what month is this may
484,0,9,0.407500,probably two months ago
484,0,9,0.730000,and i argued
484,0,9,0.391818,via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but
484,0,9,0.269200,i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor
484,0,9,0.570000,um
484,0,9,0.381111,with a friend i've had for a few years
484,0,9,0.910000,i felt anxious
484,0,9,0.620000,um
484,0,9,0.590000,sad and angry
484,0,9,0.630000,um
484,0,9,0.370000,yeah those are the main emotions
484,0,9,0.322632,i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them
484,0,9,0.446667,and then i'll notice the physical
484,0,9,0.405000,uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty
484,0,9,0.385000,if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me
484,0,9,0.820000,hmm <laughter>
484,0,9,0.345714,that i wish i had handled differently
484,0,9,0.412857,i guess related to this argument um
484,0,9,0.544286,i went out one night and got
484,0,9,0.382222,a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up
484,0,9,0.308333,calling a person for a ride
484,0,9,0.666667,home but that
484,0,9,0.457500,really upset that person
484,0,9,0.312500,and i know that
484,0,9,0.323684,it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um
484,0,9,0.324000,it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did
484,0,9,0.390000,mm
484,0,9,0.290000,<clears throat>
484,0,9,1.083333,hardest decision <sigh>
484,0,9,0.585000,wow um
484,0,9,0.413333,probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards
484,0,9,0.321250,well after dropping out i had to really
484,0,9,0.318571,rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to
484,0,9,0.328571,dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on
484,0,9,0.515000,um <sigh>
484,0,9,0.319000,i think by recognizing what i don't want to do
484,0,9,0.401429,and doing a lot of research on
484,0,9,0.428462,program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program
484,0,9,0.512500,<sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>
484,0,9,0.415000,oh <laughter>
484,0,9,0.780000,um
484,0,9,0.350000,revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier
484,0,9,0.426667,it was a dating relationship and
484,0,9,0.218889,a few years ago we had a falling out
484,0,9,0.498000,over his treatment of me
484,0,9,0.523333,and it involved
484,0,9,0.534286,another person and i wish i could
484,0,9,0.383333,get that out of my mind
484,0,9,0.980000,um <laughter>
484,0,9,0.770000,<laughter>
484,0,9,0.295833,i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten
484,0,9,0.268571,um closer to her as an adult
484,0,9,0.448000,uh we talk pretty regularly
484,0,9,0.250000,with my dad i grew up with him
484,0,9,0.520000,mostly he lives in atlanta and
484,0,9,0.332857,um we don't talk as much but
484,0,9,0.540000,we are
484,0,9,0.257000,we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that
484,0,9,0.490000,contentious or anything
484,0,9,0.300000,and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family
484,0,9,0.495000,um so
484,0,9,0.558889,in general i'm not really that close to family
484,0,9,0.670000,um
484,0,9,0.550000,one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five
484,0,9,0.317059,and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really
484,0,9,0.401667,opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things
484,0,9,0.377500,<sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up
484,0,9,0.376471,because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day
484,0,9,0.313333,and the thought of it is
484,0,9,0.320667,you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired
484,0,9,0.562500,not really feeling refreshed
484,0,9,0.440000,<clears throat>
484,0,9,0.437500,i think just <sigh>
484,0,9,0.441250,self-talk about how what i have to do
484,0,9,0.276087,isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year
484,0,9,0.600000,um
484,0,9,0.298333,trying to think of things that
484,0,9,0.385385,i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music
484,0,9,0.322222,and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going
484,0,9,0.873333,<sigh> feeling <sigh>
484,0,9,0.636667,uh wow um
484,0,9,0.630000,feeling
484,0,9,0.581667,emotionally drained on some ways and
484,0,9,0.309286,at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown
484,0,9,0.410833,so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of
484,0,9,0.383750,feeling accomplished and proud at the same time
484,0,9,0.380000,no i haven't
484,0,9,0.630000,yes
484,0,9,0.532500,in two thousand six
484,0,9,0.490000,the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um
484,0,9,0.293182,i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous
484,0,9,0.412857,and just all those changes going on
484,0,9,0.890000,really um
484,0,9,0.485000,exacerbated 
484,0,9,0.280909,things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there
484,0,9,0.242500,and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed
484,0,9,0.416667,yes i do
484,0,9,0.550000,yes
484,0,9,0.670000,i notice
484,0,9,0.662500,i'm better able to
484,0,9,0.466364,accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them
484,0,9,0.565000,i'm <sigh>
484,0,9,0.375000,able to think <th>
484,0,9,0.334000,think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light
484,0,9,0.876667,and also identify
484,0,9,0.388571,the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas
484,0,9,0.290000,<clears throat>
484,0,9,0.695000,mm <sigh>
484,0,9,0.445000,um this past weekend
484,0,9,0.302500,i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again
484,0,9,1.106667,<laughter> um <sigh>
484,0,9,0.314545,people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very
484,0,9,0.785000,um analytical
484,0,9,1.035000,sensitive intelligent
484,0,9,1.070000,intellectual
484,0,9,0.530000,um
484,0,9,0.298333,i wish that i did not
484,0,9,0.290000,or wait
484,0,9,0.425000,i wish
484,0,9,0.361333,i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on
484,0,9,0.402222,and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy
484,0,9,0.390000,<laughter>
484,0,9,0.558571,start going to therapy now <laughter> um
484,0,9,0.356667,but yeah i really would and
484,0,9,1.160000,also
484,0,9,1.080000,to
484,0,9,0.274286,what how old am i twenty eight
484,0,9,0.434000,ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school
484,0,9,0.305833,i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future
484,0,9,0.352000,and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career
484,0,9,0.660000,um
484,0,9,0.208889,i think the fact that i'm in grad school
484,0,9,0.600000,and
484,0,9,0.286000,coming from the background that i that i come from
484,0,9,0.865000,low socio-economic status and
484,0,9,0.586667,just pushing through
484,0,9,0.425000,challenges to get here
484,0,9,0.470000,<laughter>
484,0,9,0.385000,you're welcome
484,0,9,0.450000,bye
477,0,2,0.810000,<synch>
477,0,2,0.395000,yes thanks
477,0,2,0.255714,i'm well thank you how are you
477,0,2,0.222000,i grew up in oklahoma
477,0,2,0.300000,mhm
477,0,2,0.192714,um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here
477,0,2,0.300000,my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much
477,0,2,0.270000,<sniffle>
477,0,2,0.535000,oklahoma's very different um
477,0,2,0.328333,uh l_a's a lot more exciting
477,0,2,0.274000,there's a lot more um
477,0,2,0.421667,uh to do here and um
477,0,2,0.298750,uh the ocean obviously is very nice so
477,0,2,0.480000,um
477,0,2,0.301250,you know that's a good question i um
477,0,2,0.306923,i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and
477,0,2,0.209091,i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come
477,0,2,0.260000,very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made
477,0,2,0.300000,<laughter>
477,0,2,0.271818,pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural
477,0,2,0.146667,it seemed like a good fit
477,0,2,0.185714,um i just really like it here
477,0,2,0.198000,oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach
477,0,2,0.256154,um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or
477,0,2,0.250435,um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice
477,0,2,0.350000,mm
477,0,2,0.447778,i studied philosophy and um political theory and government
477,0,2,0.208182,and did a little bit of english literature on the side
477,0,2,0.355000,um it
477,0,2,0.271250,kind of just happened naturally i think uh
477,0,2,0.240000,i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different
477,0,2,0.530000,areas and
477,0,2,0.276000,i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
477,0,2,0.320000,um
477,0,2,0.287500,not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities
477,0,2,0.413333,um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often
477,0,2,0.825000,<laughter> um
477,0,2,0.406364,you know i have actually studied to become a success coach
477,0,2,0.313846,um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice
477,0,2,0.210476,aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students
477,0,2,0.256667,um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams
477,0,2,0.320769,um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that
477,0,2,0.570000,um
477,0,2,0.281000,you know it can be challenging for people to actually
477,0,2,0.272308,be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um
477,0,2,0.265238,undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it
477,0,2,0.289091,uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too
477,0,2,0.263636,um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so
477,0,2,0.230000,um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people
477,0,2,0.258235,i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged
477,0,2,0.308333,and i think that um is
477,0,2,0.278333,something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted
477,0,2,0.266897,um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers
477,0,2,0.276000,<laughter> pretty good i think
477,0,2,0.243158,um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
477,0,2,0.262353,not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no
477,0,2,0.430000,hmm
477,0,2,0.450000,hmm
477,0,2,0.236667,i'm not sure
477,0,2,0.430000,it would've probably been a discussion over politics
477,0,2,0.201250,and it probably would've been a friendly argument
477,0,2,0.480000,um
477,0,2,0.366250,probably with one of my liberal friends so
477,0,2,0.251250,but i actually can't remember the specific time
477,0,2,0.450000,<laughter>
477,0,2,0.280000,<sniffle>
477,0,2,0.340000,mm
477,0,2,0.355000,i meditate
477,0,2,0.600000,um i
477,0,2,0.226000,do that almost every day
477,0,2,0.242400,um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful
477,0,2,0.383077,um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts
477,0,2,0.323333,so that's nice
477,0,2,0.390000,mm
477,0,2,0.164444,well let me think about that for a minute
477,0,2,1.350000,<sigh>
477,0,2,0.360000,hmm
477,0,2,0.219091,<laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um
477,0,2,0.410000,just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>
477,0,2,0.760000,<sigh>
477,0,2,0.370000,hmm
477,0,2,0.370000,okay i'm sorry <laughter>
477,0,2,0.480000,hmm
477,0,2,0.315333,well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly
477,0,2,0.321000,um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but
477,0,2,0.283333,um i do have it sometimes
477,0,2,0.225385,probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it
477,0,2,0.117143,you know if i didn't have it
477,0,2,0.211000,um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um
477,0,2,0.493333,it's usually me in school somewhere
477,0,2,0.223333,at the end of the semester
477,0,2,0.351667,haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail
477,0,2,0.640000,and
477,0,2,0.325000,you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i
477,0,2,0.254444,study and attend class the way i should have
477,0,2,0.242273,um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating
477,0,2,0.244000,and i'm not exactly sure
477,0,2,0.296429,why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
477,0,2,0.256000,no i don't think so
477,0,2,0.227778,um at least not not that i'm aware of
477,0,2,0.500000,<sniffle>
477,0,2,0.256667,i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew
477,0,2,0.170000,and they live on the east coast
477,0,2,0.380909,and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um
477,0,2,0.262727,i when i used to live there when he was younger
477,0,2,0.233333,um spent a lot of time with them and
477,0,2,0.253000,since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so
477,0,2,0.252000,for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back
477,0,2,0.226667,in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them
477,0,2,0.292500,um and that i felt bad about because
477,0,2,0.316250,we really enjoy each other's company and he
477,0,2,0.255600,um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back
477,0,2,0.423333,so that's um
477,0,2,0.231667,that makes me feel bad sometimes
477,0,2,0.360000,mm
477,0,2,0.620000,um
477,0,2,0.211000,well i have a brother i'm very close to him
477,0,2,0.520000,he's younger
477,0,2,0.880000,and
477,0,2,0.239000,um he's like four four and a half years younger
477,0,2,0.297143,he's married um i have a nephew
477,0,2,0.298889,um my both of my parents have passed away
477,0,2,0.272692,so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them
477,0,2,0.520000,um
477,0,2,0.447143,on my father's side there's one brother
477,0,2,0.215769,um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are
477,0,2,0.475556,<sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um
477,0,2,0.236071,most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um
477,0,2,0.200000,so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then
477,0,2,0.230000,but you know we're not that close with our extended family so
477,0,2,0.600000,um
477,0,2,0.313333,i'd say well
477,0,2,0.237059,um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences
477,0,2,4.380000,scrubbed_entry
477,0,2,0.263333,when i came out to california
477,0,2,0.560000,um
477,0,2,0.274800,i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um
477,0,2,0.265833,it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so
477,0,2,0.264118,um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and
477,0,2,0.320000,um we just established this really strong friendship and
477,0,2,0.256364,she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um
477,0,2,0.229730,but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um
477,0,2,0.219756,and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know
477,0,2,0.197727,i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice
477,0,2,0.423333,i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um
477,0,2,0.390000,sometimes my you know
477,0,2,0.219677,depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but
477,0,2,0.262667,um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful
477,0,2,0.286000,um and i can sleep
477,0,2,0.420000,uh
477,0,2,0.263636,you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles
477,0,2,0.690000,so
477,0,2,0.235200,um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination
477,0,2,0.164167,um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night
477,0,2,0.162000,or at least if i do i don't remember it
477,0,2,0.300000,so
477,0,2,0.227241,um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit
477,0,2,0.222857,because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home
477,0,2,0.181250,most of the time but then i travel
477,0,2,0.184000,like one week a month
477,0,2,0.225000,and when i travel i'll take the red-eye
477,0,2,0.186522,um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i
477,0,2,0.405000,um sleep
477,0,2,0.252667,poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep
477,0,2,0.487500,and the first day
477,0,2,0.301111,after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay
477,0,2,0.233333,but usually the second day is not very good
477,0,2,0.286429,um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate
477,0,2,0.610000,and um
477,0,2,0.151818,i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
477,0,2,0.157500,i would say good
477,0,2,0.390000,um
477,0,2,0.236818,summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little
477,0,2,0.188095,um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about
477,0,2,0.270000,um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good
477,0,2,0.271000,not really i can't i can't think of anything um
477,0,2,0.295714,there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um
477,0,2,0.436667,and i hike with friends and
477,0,2,0.233143,um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated
477,0,2,0.235000,um because i didn't really exercise when i was there
477,0,2,0.224359,and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
477,0,2,0.340000,it's okay
477,0,2,0.200000,thank you
477,0,2,0.250000,no
477,0,2,0.320000,no
477,0,2,0.385000,hmm well
477,0,2,3.290000,scrubbed_entry
477,0,2,0.271667,he's a lot of fun and
477,0,2,0.282273,um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and
477,0,2,0.245000,we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and
477,0,2,0.202105,um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun
477,0,2,0.390000,hmm
477,0,2,1.030000,<sigh>
477,0,2,0.314545,well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun
477,0,2,0.210000,but that i can be serious
477,0,2,0.805000,and um
477,0,2,0.317143,that i you know care about others
477,0,2,0.440000,uh
477,0,2,0.262500,and that i'm loyal
477,0,2,0.790000,and
477,0,2,0.210000,i'm not sure what else
477,0,2,0.590000,um
477,0,2,0.234444,i think those those are probably the main things
477,0,2,0.380000,<sniffle>
477,0,2,0.374444,um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so
477,0,2,0.590000,um
477,0,2,0.235000,i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem
477,0,2,0.250000,uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar
477,0,2,0.251667,i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging
477,0,2,0.504286,um and i wish that i um
477,0,2,0.230000,xxx
477,0,2,0.160000,i don't know
477,0,2,0.440000,uh
477,0,2,0.235000,i think i wish that i was in a relationship
477,0,2,0.390000,so
477,0,2,0.310000,probably those things
477,0,2,0.330000,mm
477,0,2,0.450000,hmm
477,0,2,0.281000,so at the last organization i used to work at
477,0,2,0.325714,i had a boss and she was
477,0,2,0.302857,i don't feel like she was um
477,0,2,0.380909,i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh
477,0,2,0.227778,used to push my buttons or so i thought
477,0,2,0.586667,and so um
477,0,2,0.219643,one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
477,0,2,0.408750,um and he was upset about something and
477,0,2,0.306957,it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
477,0,2,0.420000,um
477,0,2,0.318571,but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i
477,0,2,0.387500,have very strong opinions about how you handle
477,0,2,0.382857,challenges with people <peo> with staff members
477,0,2,0.258667,and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought
477,0,2,0.304615,um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel
477,0,2,0.248125,um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
477,0,2,0.560000,and um
477,0,2,0.235000,i did you know
477,0,2,0.218571,i tried to be very calm and
477,0,2,0.188824,said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but
477,0,2,0.262222,uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
477,0,2,0.207879,to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
477,0,2,0.240000,or after we had that interaction so
477,0,2,1.420000,<laughter>
477,0,2,0.234667,so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this
477,0,2,0.261429,thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had
477,0,2,0.265000,read it back then
477,0,2,0.370000,which is
477,0,2,0.298000,um when you think about buying something instead of thinking
477,0,2,0.490000,uh oh
477,0,2,0.246000,here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it
477,0,2,0.182105,it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
477,0,2,0.287000,because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
477,0,2,0.140000,you know
477,0,2,0.325000,intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
477,0,2,0.217667,you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
477,0,2,0.206000,been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
477,0,2,0.772500,<sigh> probably
477,0,2,5.430000,scrubbed_entry
477,0,2,0.266111,um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them
477,0,2,0.254000,and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them
477,0,2,0.330000,so
477,0,2,0.613333,<sigh> let's see
477,0,2,0.335192,well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore
477,0,2,0.218750,uh and i got to fly first class
477,0,2,0.314167,um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um
477,0,2,0.343333,tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because
477,0,2,0.299697,um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too
477,0,2,0.340000,sure

409,0,10,0.280000,yeah
409,0,10,0.198684,uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag
409,0,10,0.490000,and um
409,0,10,0.187500,i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas
409,0,10,0.180769,i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh
409,0,10,0.180000,it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it
409,0,10,0.338000,but uh overall it's okay
409,0,10,0.275758,uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>
409,0,10,0.198889,that's why that's my that was my major yeah
409,0,10,1.070000,um
409,0,10,0.181176,i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh
409,0,10,0.210667,it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the
409,0,10,0.240000,in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um
409,0,10,0.218182,you didn't see you know too many computers around back then
409,0,10,0.245000,and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together
409,0,10,0.227500,you know solving a
409,0,10,0.219643,a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the
409,0,10,0.321500,the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um
409,0,10,0.260000,the problem
409,0,10,0.320000,mhm
409,0,10,0.510000,uh
409,0,10,0.204348,no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time
409,0,10,0.245833,um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di>
409,0,10,0.252105,uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um
409,0,10,0.170000,the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was
409,0,10,0.250833,i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it
409,0,10,0.245714,to the degree that i wanted to
409,0,10,0.356667,wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh
409,0,10,0.207059,well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time
409,0,10,0.147059,this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um
409,0,10,0.220667,at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing
409,0,10,0.178095,job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much
409,0,10,0.182857,too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know
409,0,10,0.207692,i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel
409,0,10,0.293333,fulfillment on but i don't wanna
409,0,10,0.132105,too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice
409,0,10,0.475000,relaxing job
409,0,10,0.390000,yeah <laughter>
409,0,10,0.320000,yeah
409,0,10,0.272500,oh i would say
409,0,10,0.235625,well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing
409,0,10,0.430000,um but
409,0,10,0.228636,i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more
409,0,10,0.200588,vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much
409,0,10,0.157000,like once the funny gates open up they kind of
409,0,10,0.390000,<laughter>
409,0,10,0.162308,open up too much so i have to like back off you know
409,0,10,0.223571,but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor
409,0,10,0.403333,oh really <laughter>
409,0,10,0.710000,<laughter>
409,0,10,0.500000,yeah <laughter>
409,0,10,0.680000,oh um
409,0,10,0.275000,well i listen to music um
409,0,10,0.368571,i'll um well i watch t_v um
409,0,10,0.510000,i'll um
409,0,10,0.228750,just what what do i do to relax
409,0,10,0.232381,well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too
409,0,10,0.258000,i'll be around an area
409,0,10,0.360000,around
409,0,10,0.184286,kind of a comfort area where i
409,0,10,0.173333,i feel safe i can just
409,0,10,0.210000,dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my
409,0,10,0.195000,thinking about my own
409,0,10,0.284444,problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus
409,0,10,0.222500,on being in the moment with my um
409,0,10,0.254000,acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances
409,0,10,0.237273,um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem
409,0,10,0.204545,it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode
409,0,10,0.126111,i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more
409,0,10,0.174118,had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh
409,0,10,0.205556,uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going
409,0,10,0.340000,yeah
409,0,10,0.286000,wow that's a good question
409,0,10,0.550000,um
409,0,10,0.242857,i'm not sure to be honest um
409,0,10,0.164167,i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that
409,0,10,0.294286,it's not really part of my repertoire
409,0,10,0.248000,um nothing comes to mind off top of my head
409,0,10,0.420000,well
409,0,10,0.480000,um
409,0,10,0.155714,well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments
409,0,10,0.374000,back about ten years ago
409,0,10,0.302500,i was more um
409,0,10,0.175714,i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people
409,0,10,0.232667,like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field
409,0,10,0.395000,and um
409,0,10,0.213571,i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it
409,0,10,0.211304,and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity
409,0,10,0.238571,and um unfortunately i made some bad
409,0,10,0.190000,financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad
409,0,10,0.234828,position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up
409,0,10,0.282000,so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions
409,0,10,0.222500,that i really regret
409,0,10,0.450000,wow
409,0,10,0.780000,hmm
409,0,10,0.197500,that's a tough one
409,0,10,0.175000,i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>
409,0,10,0.400000,okay
409,0,10,0.350000,oh
409,0,10,0.228824,well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um
409,0,10,0.240000,it's just me and my uncle
409,0,10,0.230909,and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um
409,0,10,0.202222,he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida
409,0,10,0.334000,so uh we're we're okay
409,0,10,0.485000,but um
409,0,10,0.227059,uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um
409,0,10,0.176486,we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep
409,0,10,0.227143,and uh he's got his own problems
409,0,10,0.291818,so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation
409,0,10,0.198462,and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have
409,0,10,0.151875,so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel
409,0,10,0.271667,i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in
409,0,10,0.198462,um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem
409,0,10,0.330000,and um
409,0,10,0.110000,i have
409,0,10,0.206250,a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom
409,0,10,0.365000,and um
409,0,10,0.178000,so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a
409,0,10,0.275000,long story short <laughter>
409,0,10,0.890000,um
409,0,10,0.198571,it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired
409,0,10,0.305000,or achy
409,0,10,0.153333,so it is it is difficult
409,0,10,0.435000,uh <sigh>
409,0,10,0.305000,well i've been feeling okay i mean um
409,0,10,0.304286,i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um
409,0,10,0.292222,i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't
409,0,10,0.500000,taken uh responsibility for
409,0,10,0.505000,but um
409,0,10,0.268889,i feel a bit of calmness as of late
409,0,10,0.300000,no
409,0,10,0.258462,well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um
409,0,10,0.241500,i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h
409,0,10,0.446667,the minnesota multifaceted
409,0,10,0.355000,personality something of whether
409,0,10,0.282500,this is going back about six months ago
409,0,10,0.200588,they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my
409,0,10,0.271818,my well being psychologically too and i think some of the
409,0,10,0.218000,the answers said that they
409,0,10,0.284444,advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist
409,0,10,0.165000,i didn't follow that
409,0,10,0.240000,up on that because
409,0,10,0.486667,of philosophical differences
409,0,10,0.152000,but uh i think i might have a you know
409,0,10,0.326000,a mild case of depression
409,0,10,0.470000,well you know um
409,0,10,0.188571,like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh
409,0,10,0.211250,i'm doing okay but i you know i
409,0,10,0.238182,kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my
409,0,10,0.241111,my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone
409,0,10,0.187083,i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to
409,0,10,0.211176,and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh
409,0,10,0.293571,there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties
409,0,10,0.415000,so um
409,0,10,0.186667,you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to
409,0,10,0.480000,wow
409,0,10,0.380000,that's a good one <laughter>
409,0,10,0.593333,really happy um
409,0,10,0.151429,let me think about that a minute
409,0,10,0.220588,well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth>
409,0,10,0.153846,okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer
409,0,10,0.210000,um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow
409,0,10,0.200625,it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh
409,0,10,0.228333,we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters
409,0,10,0.350000,giving out really nice samples
409,0,10,0.197333,it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a
409,0,10,0.355000,and um
409,0,10,0.250000,you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like
409,0,10,0.292857,have me experience their product or service
409,0,10,0.455000,and um
409,0,10,0.264000,i was around people that
409,0,10,0.242500,i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh
409,0,10,0.150769,i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh
409,0,10,0.172500,about a month ago
409,0,10,0.320000,yeah
409,0,10,0.176667,yeah it was
409,0,10,0.415000,best friend
409,0,10,0.157500,i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh
409,0,10,0.477500,i would say um
409,0,10,0.740000,hmm
409,0,10,0.188636,i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh
409,0,10,0.270000,i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>
409,0,10,0.610000,um
409,0,10,0.241429,i i like to be conscientious i
409,0,10,0.190833,you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall
409,0,10,0.246190,i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know
409,0,10,0.244286,say little white lies or you know
409,0,10,0.202187,i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic
409,0,10,0.610000,um
409,0,10,0.125000,i tend to be
409,0,10,0.223333,pretty calm for the most part
409,0,10,0.860000,um
409,0,10,0.237500,what do i regret
409,0,10,0.233333,well can you elaborate that <laughter>
409,0,10,0.536667,uh well um
409,0,10,0.406667,i just well just overall um
409,0,10,0.456667,i regret uh
409,0,10,0.219000,not being a little more assertive in in my earlier
409,0,10,0.447500,uh earlier life um
409,0,10,0.210000,and kinda put myself in this position
409,0,10,0.192273,it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life
409,0,10,0.290000,i made some bad decisions and unfortunately
409,0,10,0.130714,i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like
409,0,10,0.213333,sort of like
409,0,10,0.330769,living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing
409,0,10,0.175000,so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all
409,0,10,0.251875,well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um
409,0,10,0.325000,i think
409,0,10,0.284000,i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice
409,0,10,0.203333,i was kinda going away from
409,0,10,0.270000,my basic
409,0,10,0.258889,beingness you know like the way i really felt
409,0,10,0.223333,like for example i'd make i would do aggressive
409,0,10,0.199048,uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been
409,0,10,0.144444,well off for the rest of my life <laughter>
409,0,10,0.294286,but unfortunately it went the opposite way
409,0,10,0.204286,too too many eggs in that basket
409,0,10,0.220000,so i kinda regretted going with
409,0,10,0.278000,my gut feeling and and let other people influence me
409,0,10,0.300000,and uh
409,0,10,0.245333,'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments
409,0,10,0.167500,in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some
409,0,10,0.346667,aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much
409,0,10,0.182857,kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret
409,0,10,0.260000,yeah
409,0,10,0.550000,wow

338,1,15,0.293333,preschool teacher 
338,1,15,0.364375,well i've always worked with children ever since i was eighteen years old so i figured
338,1,15,0.334667,doing something helping someone it doesn't pay well but you're investing in the future 
338,1,15,0.331364,wow some job that i could get paid to be outside all day get paid well to be outside all day 
338,1,15,0.260000,yes 
338,1,15,0.371765,i'm kinda quiet but i also like i probably would say borderline i like outside activities but i mainly kinda do um activities probably by myself so yeah i would say i'm an introvert
338,1,15,0.500000,slightly
338,1,15,0.591000,uh wow just um maybe a racist or disrespectful person
338,1,15,0.311143,i kinda shut down and and reevaluate how i am as a person how i'm coming off to other people i can't change anyone else's personality but i can work on my own  
338,1,15,0.160000,i'm pretty good 
338,1,15,0.243333,i usually don't argue with people i usually walk away i mean a argument doesn't settle anything 
338,1,15,0.292400,wow it's a lot of things i regret but it's not anything that i can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother 
338,1,15,0.160000,thank you 
338,1,15,0.277727,i was extremely close to my mother that was who i am as a person who made me as a person 
338,1,15,0.411250,wow twenty ten years ago i would tell myself not to be so angry so 
338,1,15,0.330000,upset all the time about things i can't control i would tell myself to relax and
338,1,15,0.234286,not be so hard on myself 
338,1,15,0.230526,i think that's pretty cool i think you should have different avenues to deal with different people

338,1,15,0.190000,um less than a month 
338,1,15,0.322593,i realized i have to evaluate myself as a person so i can't really look to anyone else to help me unless i i start with myself
338,1,15,0.140000,no i don't 
406,0,2,0.440000, <synch>

406,0,2,0.250000,<clears throat>
406,0,2,0.580000,hmm
406,0,2,0.247143,well sometimes i don't like the traffic
406,0,2,0.208889,i don't think there's really too much i don't like about l_a i really do like l_a though
406,0,2,0.490000,<laughter>
406,0,2,0.480909,no i i haven't really traveled in about um five years

406,0,2,0.518000,i just haven't traveled <laughter>
406,0,2,0.344783,<deep breath> um i like going to new places and seeing things i haven't seen before and if i can like visiting um
406,0,2,0.450000,places like landmarks
406,0,2,0.285714,well the last one i did was san francisco that wasn't so far but i got to stay in downtown san francisco and i got to go shopping
406,0,2,0.248000,and i got to get on a um the street car so that was cool
406,0,2,0.210000,xxx
406,0,2,0.391429,well i still study i'm studying psychology
406,0,2,0.300000,mhm
406,0,2,0.630000,hmm
406,0,2,0.450000,well <sigh>
406,0,2,0.293529,i decided to go back to school um just pretty quickly so i went to junior college
406,0,2,0.360714,and then when it got close to graduate i knew i wanna transfer so
406,0,2,0.246364,i'd taken a a couple psychology courses and i decided i liked it so i just decided to make that my major
406,0,2,0.270000,and it
406,0,2,0.211667,i thought it didn't have a lot of math but it had
406,0,2,0.335000,enough math <laughter> so
406,0,2,0.347000,<deep breath> mm <sigh> well now that i'm almost done
406,0,2,0.278000,i don't know if i'm gonna continue in that area
406,0,2,0.345000,well what i wanted initially was to um <sigh> get into sports psychology but i'm not
406,0,2,0.265714,quite sure that's what i want either
406,0,2,0.450000,well
406,0,2,0.238667,i could be shy initially but um once you get to know me i'm outgoing
406,0,2,0.320000,<laughter>
406,0,2,0.420000,<laughter>
406,0,2,0.355556,<sigh> i think i either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on netflix
406,0,2,0.312667,well just a good movie i like foreign movies a lot um so a lotta
406,0,2,0.293636,right now i'm into um martial arts movie with subtitles so
406,0,2,0.222000,i think i'm pretty good
406,0,2,0.790000,hmm
406,0,2,0.410000,you know i know
406,0,2,0.219592,they're not really long arguments i don't know if they're real arguments i know i argued with my boyfriend um <laughter> 'cause he hung up in my face but i don't know why and it got solved pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really that important
406,0,2,0.233750,wait i walked out without say oh okay
406,0,2,0.540000,hmm
406,0,2,0.180000,i can't think of one right now
406,0,2,1.320000,<sigh>
406,0,2,0.525000,i think
406,0,2,0.455000,the hardest decision i probably had to make
406,0,2,0.545000,was moving
406,0,2,0.485714,from well back to california from oregon
406,0,2,0.201111,well i was really young so i was um
406,0,2,0.284000,nineteen twenty-ish and i was really by myself so that was pretty hard 'cause obviously i had to support myself
406,0,2,0.295556,because it was really really boring in oregon so um i really like the activity here in l_a
406,0,2,0.230000,you know i don't really feel guilty about many things
406,0,2,0.364063,well i don't talk to them that much um my dad my stepmom live in oregon so i probably talk to 'em on the phone at least once or twice a month
406,0,2,0.251563,and then when they come out here i wanna say at least once a year sometimes it can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often then i see them
406,0,2,0.450000,um
406,0,2,0.278000,that's about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well
406,0,2,0.370000,yeah
406,0,2,0.310000,hmm
406,0,2,0.252000,well i've had lots of positive influences i think um
406,0,2,0.320000,just regular people i come across you know maybe someone i've worked with maybe
406,0,2,0.254583,um like oh actually my uncle he's a really good positive influence he um he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice
406,0,2,0.230000,mm about <bout> life
406,0,2,0.530000,hmm
406,0,2,0.237368,you know i don't really think i've had anything that bad happen to me where i just don't uh
406,0,2,0.190769,where it bothers me so much i have to not think about it
406,0,2,0.325000,pretty <pret>
406,0,2,0.241579,well i can't say pretty easy 'cause i work odd schedule and then i go to school but um
406,0,2,0.203333,yeah if i wanna go to sleep i sleep really well though as long as i have enough you know hours
406,0,2,0.382000,really really happy and good
406,0,2,0.530000,<laughter>
406,0,2,0.360000,nope
406,0,2,0.300000,no
406,0,2,0.495000,<deep breath>
406,0,2,0.411429,i'm always happy uh <laughter> gosh yesterday
406,0,2,0.250769,um i'm just happy any time i talk to my boyfriend or if i go out and do something i'm just happy um i got off work i'm happy 'cause i'm done for the day i'm just really happy
406,0,2,0.286364,um i'm on spring break i'm really happy right now so
406,0,2,0.525000,<deep breath> hmm <sigh>
406,0,2,0.405294,oh i haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat
406,0,2,0.502500,but the last activity
406,0,2,0.288947,that i had a lot of fun doing was ice skating um in december downtown <dow> in downtown l_a
406,0,2,0.251250,no i don't really have too many regrets i mean whatever happens happens and you know it was meant to play out that way
406,0,2,0.760000,hmm
406,0,2,0.685000,well um
406,0,2,0.321429,i guess i would say don't worry too much about the small things um
406,0,2,0.330714,even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and uh
406,0,2,0.240000,you won't think about it six months from now
406,0,2,0.253333,i think my
406,0,2,0.329583,best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a fun person i'm pretty easy to get along with i think most people like me
406,0,2,0.253333,and i'm just a cool person
406,0,2,0.345000,hmm well i wish i could study more i wish i would study more
406,0,2,0.451111,i wish that uh <sigh> i would exercise more
406,0,2,0.621667,and i wish that uh that's
406,0,2,0.175714,yeah i think that's it right there
406,0,2,0.620000,hmm
406,0,2,2.990000,<sigh>
406,0,2,0.223750,i don't think i wanna talk about that
406,0,2,0.690000,hmm
406,0,2,0.261429,i don't know i guess uh just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home i guess that's about the best accomplishment there is
406,0,2,0.220000,thank you
406,0,2,0.460000,bye
455,0,1,0.890000,<synch>
455,0,1,0.350000,yes
455,0,1,0.360000,very well
455,0,1,0.450000,uh ohio
455,0,1,0.340000,mhm
455,0,1,0.407000,uh finished school and came out to start my life
455,0,1,0.527500,uh not often now
455,0,1,0.270000,not really often
455,0,1,0.292381,uh because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home
455,0,1,0.310000,prior
455,0,1,0.383333,uh there's really not a comparison
455,0,1,0.321667,you know this is warm and
455,0,1,0.510000,sunny
455,0,1,0.328182,and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment
455,0,1,0.204000,i it took a minute
455,0,1,0.444286,to get adjusted to the different culture
455,0,1,0.231538,but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here
455,0,1,0.216000,uh i love the weather
455,0,1,0.446667,i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains
455,0,1,0.351765,and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here
455,0,1,0.385000,uh i
455,0,1,0.497778,tend to not have things that i don't like
455,0,1,0.275833,uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there
455,0,1,0.285333,so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like
455,0,1,0.323333,yes i do
455,0,1,0.367143,uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences
455,0,1,0.303077,and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between
455,0,1,0.266000,uh all types of people
455,0,1,0.334000,it's a very rich experience
455,0,1,0.860000,um
455,0,1,0.340000,which one
455,0,1,0.215000,to where
455,0,1,0.600000,uh i
455,0,1,0.336923,guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there
455,0,1,0.302500,uh as i go
455,0,1,0.532500,the people and the
455,0,1,0.330833,warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue
455,0,1,0.391667,through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that
455,0,1,0.311429,there are so many there really are
455,0,1,0.497500,but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque
455,0,1,0.248571,which was just really pure and it
455,0,1,0.521667,really stayed with me how similar
455,0,1,0.337500,we actually all are
455,0,1,0.306111,um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips
455,0,1,0.260000,uh there
455,0,1,0.880000,and
455,0,1,0.450000,let's see
455,0,1,0.285625,just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too
455,0,1,0.416154,wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um
455,0,1,0.723333,entertainment i've studied communications i've studied
455,0,1,0.265000,whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman
455,0,1,0.480000,<laughter>
455,0,1,0.965000,<laughter>
455,0,1,0.321765,ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy
455,0,1,0.293333,keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive
455,0,1,0.334444,and um just allows me to be able to
455,0,1,0.322500,be fully developed as a human being being able to do that
455,0,1,0.310000,mhm
455,0,1,0.800000,um
455,0,1,0.325000,i don't have a dream job
455,0,1,0.300000,per se
455,0,1,0.501429,what i do have is a um
455,0,1,0.233125,desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose
455,0,1,0.402000,on a daily basis so
455,0,1,0.387500,uh probably more outgoing
455,0,1,0.400000,mhm
455,0,1,0.460000,<laughter>
455,0,1,0.388519,well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform
455,0,1,0.472500,before i move uh around i get exercise
455,0,1,0.334444,so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving
455,0,1,0.334286,and uh then move forward from there
455,0,1,0.396667,uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore
455,0,1,0.990000,argued
455,0,1,1.270000,um
455,0,1,0.374545,cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument
455,0,1,1.150000,um
455,0,1,0.164000,don't know what it's about
455,0,1,0.278750,i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money
455,0,1,0.302857,situation i wish i had handled differently
455,0,1,0.346471,you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets
455,0,1,0.352857,to hold guilt about the way anything
455,0,1,0.446364,uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences
455,0,1,0.312941,uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as
455,0,1,0.330909,needing them to be different i need to learn from them
455,0,1,0.463750,or to um just really accept what is
455,0,1,0.410000,mhm
455,0,1,0.350000,hardest decision i've ever had to make
455,0,1,0.800000,um
455,0,1,0.300000,don't really have a quote on quote hard
455,0,1,0.379000,decision you know because i grew up in a way
455,0,1,0.396667,uh where my mother was extremely
455,0,1,0.352941,wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life
455,0,1,0.272632,and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say
455,0,1,0.246667,it's your life
455,0,1,0.530000,and so
455,0,1,0.498571,um for me decisions don't really come
455,0,1,0.510000,as difficult to make
455,0,1,0.256667,they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood
455,0,1,0.160000,so i don't really have a
455,0,1,0.475000,most difficult
455,0,1,0.255000,decision i've ever made
455,0,1,0.570000,mm
455,0,1,0.304286,event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to
455,0,1,0.472222,erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase
455,0,1,0.249167,uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out
455,0,1,0.750000,uh
455,0,1,0.470000,great uh a little more
455,0,1,0.900000,uh
455,0,1,0.528000,physical exertion than normal 
455,0,1,0.272500,but uh still great
455,0,1,0.390000,<laughter>
455,0,1,0.412143,mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to
455,0,1,0.285000,the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty
455,0,1,0.560000,even tempered
455,0,1,0.640000,no
455,0,1,0.160000,mm
455,0,1,0.640000,no
455,0,1,0.235000,uh that's pretty much every day
455,0,1,0.349091,<laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful
455,0,1,0.380000,for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it

455,0,1,0.580000,uh outgoing
455,0,1,0.266250,that's probably probably what my friends would say
455,0,1,0.288889,uh there's really nothing that i think i need
455,0,1,0.293571,<laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself
455,0,1,0.194444,like i'm okay with everything the way it is
455,0,1,0.285000,really am
455,0,1,0.500000,<laughter>
455,0,1,0.196667,what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago
455,0,1,0.520000,to know
455,0,1,1.420000,um
455,0,1,0.284545,to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago
455,0,1,0.349167,was important in terms of developing the person that i am now
455,0,1,0.800000,and
455,0,1,0.300000,so to just
455,0,1,0.239000,be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to
455,0,1,0.324545,learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up
455,0,1,0.626667,recently really enjoyed

455,0,1,0.492222,wow my my willingness to get to know myself
455,0,1,0.537273,through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application
455,0,1,0.455000,of everything that i've learned about people cultures
455,0,1,0.662500,places and most importantly
455,0,1,0.245000,you know
455,0,1,0.192500,the god within me
455,0,1,0.650000,bye

426,1,20,0.325000,south l_a
426,1,20,0.630000,um
426,1,20,0.285000,the weather
426,1,20,0.300000,the women
426,1,20,0.395000,the opportunities
426,1,20,0.163333,that's about it
426,1,20,0.720000,racism
426,1,20,0.495000,police brutality
426,1,20,0.700000,injustice
426,1,20,0.170000,that's it
426,1,20,0.465000,mm no
426,1,20,0.313750,not much of a exploring type of person
426,1,20,0.650000,um psychology
426,1,20,0.420000,mhm
426,1,20,0.700000,um
426,1,20,0.251429,it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology
426,1,20,0.330000,yeah
426,1,20,0.250000,yes
426,1,20,0.260000,no
426,1,20,0.170000,to own my own record label
426,1,20,0.530000,um
426,1,20,0.257143,it it's moderately hard but you know
426,1,20,0.155000,take it one day at a time just
426,1,20,0.247500,i guess you know
426,1,20,0.290000,stay focused
426,1,20,0.138000,a little bit of both
426,1,20,0.560000,um
426,1,20,0.224286,i tend to be shy in um
426,1,20,0.290000,situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to
426,1,20,0.244444,and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with
426,1,20,0.180000,yeah
426,1,20,0.250000,<laughter>
426,1,20,0.820000,um
426,1,20,0.261000,turn the lights down low and listen to soft music
426,1,20,0.360000,mhm
426,1,20,0.213333,i'm getting better over the years
426,1,20,0.530000,um
426,1,20,0.213333,i think i'm
426,1,20,0.182000,pretty decent now compared to how i used to be
426,1,20,0.245000,yes ma'am
426,1,20,0.580000,um
426,1,20,0.274615,due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions
426,1,20,0.402500,i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison
426,1,20,0.230000,yeah
426,1,20,0.560000,mm
426,1,20,0.243333,i'm not sure
426,1,20,0.470000,uh
426,1,20,0.288667,i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life
426,1,20,0.198750,um it was probably a few days ago
426,1,20,0.191667,with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about
426,1,20,0.315000,her lack of communication
426,1,20,0.890000,and attentiveness
426,1,20,0.260000,yeah
426,1,20,0.470000,uh frustrated
426,1,20,0.620000,because um
426,1,20,0.200667,you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect
426,1,20,0.332000,you know the same effort
426,1,20,0.206667,by the other person when you're in a relationship
426,1,20,0.251500,and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so
426,1,20,0.184286,you know i guess i'm just learning
426,1,20,0.269000,there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um
426,1,20,0.940000,probably
426,1,20,0.336000,the most recent was uh
426,1,20,0.236000,i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation
426,1,20,0.253333,with an inmate
426,1,20,0.280000,when i was incarcerated
426,1,20,0.400000,and that
426,1,20,0.385000,made me
426,1,20,0.247500,that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time
426,1,20,0.410000,and um
426,1,20,0.342000,if i handled it differently
426,1,20,0.208667,i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner
426,1,20,0.460000,than i originally
426,1,20,0.300000,happen yeah
426,1,20,0.320000,mm
426,1,20,0.181667,there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory
426,1,20,0.560000,um
426,1,20,0.930000,probably
426,1,20,0.302500,uh my first girlfriend
426,1,20,0.710000,um
426,1,20,0.385000,she did something really uh extreme
426,1,20,0.233333,it wasn't necessary in my eyes
426,1,20,0.164167,and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life
426,1,20,0.268947,i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory
426,1,20,0.208571,along with the good memories as well
426,1,20,0.540000,um
426,1,20,0.317500,a few you few
426,1,20,0.660000,fights
426,1,20,0.218750,uh i guess you could say shoot outs
426,1,20,0.432000,um getting jumped getting robbed
426,1,20,0.198889,you know those things i think those inhibit me
426,1,20,0.282000,i guess to to explore
426,1,20,0.241429,certain areas of life that i'm not
426,1,20,0.208889,comfortable with so those are the feww things that
426,1,20,0.242222,it'd be nice if i could erase it completely
426,1,20,0.390000,yeah
426,1,20,1.140000,<sigh>
426,1,20,0.245000,hurting people that didn't need to be hurt
426,1,20,0.850000,emotionally especially um
426,1,20,0.236000,a few women in my life or in my past
426,1,20,0.540000,um
426,1,20,0.236429,probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through
426,1,20,0.250000,along with my close friends and family as well
426,1,20,0.290000,um used to be rocky
426,1,20,0.292222,growing up but as i got older and matured
426,1,20,0.550000,and
426,1,20,0.240455,the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent
426,1,20,0.277500,it's it's pretty decent
426,1,20,0.276667,mm i would say my mother
426,1,20,0.530000,um
426,1,20,0.236667,yeah my mother
426,1,20,0.640000,um
426,1,20,0.296000,well she she uh she had her share of experiences
426,1,20,0.420000,negative and positive
426,1,20,0.322500,um i admire her
426,1,20,0.248000,the struggles she's been through
426,1,20,0.580000,um
426,1,20,0.399000,she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up
426,1,20,0.311429,but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age
426,1,20,0.508000,finishing school getting her master's
426,1,20,0.293333,and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well
426,1,20,0.460000,and um
426,1,20,0.250000,probably not the best of family
426,1,20,0.220667,that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother
426,1,20,0.560000,mm
426,1,20,0.243333,it's not easy
426,1,20,0.310000,so yeah it's not easy
426,1,20,0.255455,i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues
426,1,20,0.337857,um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil
426,1,20,0.490000,but
426,1,20,0.231000,it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like
426,1,20,0.248000,it's a negative effect really
426,1,20,0.250000,yeah
426,1,20,0.242857,the medication <medi> i don't know shit
426,1,20,0.173333,i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy
426,1,20,0.202500,not good at all
426,1,20,0.630000,um
426,1,20,0.320000,yeah i mean
426,1,20,0.239000,i recently got released from prison not too long ago
426,1,20,0.376667,uh i'm older
426,1,20,0.410000,now
426,1,20,0.228333,and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be
426,1,20,0.212857,i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life
426,1,20,0.285000,you know
426,1,20,0.330000,sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just
426,1,20,0.273636,things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so
426,1,20,0.420000,yeah
426,1,20,0.166667,it's all good
426,1,20,0.443333,yeah so true
426,1,20,0.440000,yes
426,1,20,0.300000,<sniffle> about
426,1,20,0.174286,two and a half three years ago
426,1,20,0.369231,<deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of
426,1,20,0.272353,not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to
426,1,20,0.550000,understand myself
426,1,20,0.334000,how my brain works um
426,1,20,0.280000,you know so i decided to seek help maybe
426,1,20,0.174444,to better my life yeah you could say that
426,1,20,0.256667,yes i am
426,1,20,0.330000,yes
426,1,20,0.308333,yes i do actually i do
426,1,20,0.650000,mm
426,1,20,0.313333,better decision making
426,1,20,0.500000,um
426,1,20,0.378333,better tools to reflect on choices
426,1,20,0.520000,um how to control
426,1,20,0.510000,uh
426,1,20,0.417500,certain situations better yeah
426,1,20,0.680000,um
426,1,20,0.270000,<sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is
426,1,20,0.274000,i step back and and and i assess the situation
426,1,20,0.380000,you know to see what's what's the best way to to react
426,1,20,0.353333,towards the situation
426,1,20,0.262500,and by doing that
426,1,20,0.323333,it has made me more mature
426,1,20,0.343333,emotionally more mature
426,1,20,0.320000,and just
426,1,20,0.272500,has a positive outcome
426,1,20,0.470000,<laughter>
426,1,20,0.630000,um
426,1,20,0.200000,i was lying next to a beautiful woman
426,1,20,0.233750,who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most
426,1,20,0.350000,happy
426,1,20,0.263333,oh my goodness
426,1,20,1.210000,spontaneous

472,0,3,0.348000,when i'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic
472,0,3,0.335714,but it's not out of control <laughter>
472,0,3,0.700000,hmm
472,0,3,0.371364,i don't really remember i wanna say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid <laughter> some little
472,0,3,0.455000,stupid thing
472,0,3,0.670000,um
472,0,3,0.570000,my daughter is um
472,0,3,0.370000,thirty nine

472,0,3,0.397500,sweet <s> very sweet
472,0,3,1.233333,um and he's
472,0,3,0.435000,starting to
472,0,3,0.311667,be a little more goal driven
472,0,3,0.529091,um a little less satisfied with just uh the daily grind
472,0,3,0.460000,being a parent is um
472,0,3,0.700000,very challenging
472,0,3,0.307500,in a wonderful way
472,0,3,0.342500,um i think the hardest thing is is
472,0,3,0.490000,eh fear and worry for your children um
472,0,3,0.416000,today's world can be very
472,0,3,0.900000,um
472,0,3,0.550000,violent and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well-being
472,0,3,0.305000,i'm sorry
472,0,3,0.755000,oh gosh
472,0,3,0.680000,um
472,0,3,0.352308,mm friendship <frien> eh the close friendship you have with your children the
472,0,3,0.740000,the uh uh love the support the joy of just
472,0,3,0.358333,everyday little things that you share
472,0,3,0.765000,oh <laughter> well i'm i i
472,0,3,0.478750,talk to my children about anything and everything
472,0,3,0.358889,um we're very <v> have a very open communication
472,0,3,0.409286,which in my parents' generation i think children were more seen and not heard
472,0,3,1.011250,<deep breath> hmm <sigh>
472,0,3,0.386000,well with my daughter my first child i was young
472,0,3,0.420000,and inexperienced not only in being a mother but
472,0,3,0.364545,and naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general
472,0,3,0.567273,and i think probably eh most parents mm have regrets uh
472,0,3,0.359231,of uh situations they may have had their children in when they were
472,0,3,0.388000,when they were young that
472,0,3,0.273333,weren't the best
472,0,3,1.046667,<deep breath> <sigh>
472,0,3,0.445000,sometimes i feel that i should've
472,0,3,0.930000,been
472,0,3,0.955000,more aware
472,0,3,0.370000,at a younger age
472,0,3,0.489286,mm just xxx just mm decisions and situations that uh decisions you make situations you find yourself in when you're younger
472,0,3,0.575714,out of being naive and and um
472,0,3,0.466667,even though logically i know that
472,0,3,0.485556,it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time
472,0,3,0.316667,you know as you get older you eh hindsight is twenty twenty as you get older you you look back and wish that you
472,0,3,0.355556,had've been more on top of your your uh
472,0,3,0.253333,your life when you were younger
472,0,3,0.610000,oh gosh
472,0,3,0.351667,i honestly can't think of anything
472,0,3,1.530000,hmm
472,0,3,0.900000,um
472,0,3,0.252593,i don't know that i would want i i can think of an event i don't know that i would wanna erase it from my memory because
472,0,3,0.367143,eh i feel that we learn from
472,0,3,0.710000,everything
472,0,3,0.358889,and there <the> there's i i don't wanna lose the lesson that i'm to learn from that experience
472,0,3,0.448750,positive influence in my life uh my daughter
472,0,3,0.482500,my son my granddaughter
472,0,3,0.820000,um

372,1,13,0.490000,well
372,1,13,0.416667,um i've written some children's books
372,1,13,0.840000,and
372,1,13,0.460000,i've just been doing research looking
372,1,13,0.332000,into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but
372,1,13,0.260000,they're
372,1,13,0.242308,pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups
372,1,13,0.933333,<laughter> it's about
372,1,13,0.433846,a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries
372,1,13,0.378571,to not become a jerk with them
372,1,13,0.400000,and <laughter> it puts him in like a really
372,1,13,3.860000,scrubbed_entry
372,1,13,0.252143,he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life
372,1,13,0.380000,mhm
372,1,13,0.690000,um no
372,1,13,0.417500,i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter>
372,1,13,0.350909,um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing
372,1,13,0.319167,i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>
372,1,13,0.340000,so
372,1,13,0.252500,how do i cope
372,1,13,0.650000,<deep breath>
372,1,13,0.650000,um <sigh>
372,1,13,0.390000,well right now
372,1,13,0.770000,um
372,1,13,0.386667,i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so
372,1,13,0.462500,that was the problem
372,1,13,0.856667,it's so spontaneous
372,1,13,0.311250,like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and
372,1,13,0.224286,just brings a smile to your face
372,1,13,0.690000,um
372,1,13,0.270000,well when my son was younger
372,1,13,0.322222,once we were just sitting around the house and
372,1,13,0.243077,he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me
372,1,13,0.295714,mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails
372,1,13,0.382143,so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so
372,1,13,0.382500,yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen
372,1,13,0.262500,that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore
372,1,13,0.390000,<laughter>
372,1,13,0.507500,the hardest thing <sigh>
372,1,13,0.245000,not wanting to screw it up
372,1,13,0.273750,i feel a lot of stress and pressure
372,1,13,0.530000,that
372,1,13,0.280000,every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter
372,1,13,0.230909,in what kind of person my kid turns out to be
372,1,13,0.610000,and
372,1,13,0.400000,so
372,1,13,0.300000,it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>
372,1,13,0.430000,yeah
372,1,13,0.620000,yeah
372,1,13,0.560000,<laughter>
372,1,13,0.940000,definitely
372,1,13,0.770000,um
372,1,13,0.470000,hmm
372,1,13,0.465000,i think
372,1,13,0.310000,i'm different from my mom
372,1,13,0.460909,because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction
372,1,13,0.328571,i welcome it you know i welcome
372,1,13,0.331111,getting to know who my child is right now
372,1,13,0.720000,and
372,1,13,0.292667,not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just
372,1,13,0.320000,see them become the best
372,1,13,0.293077,child that they can be the best adult that they can be without
372,1,13,0.448333,molding them in that direction necessarily
372,1,13,0.410000,into a different person <laughter>
372,1,13,0.300000,so
372,1,13,0.170000,say it again
372,1,13,0.341667,who's someone that's a positive influence
372,1,13,0.530000,um <sigh>
372,1,13,1.160000,mm
372,1,13,0.354000,i don't really have anybody
372,1,13,0.265000,like that
372,1,13,0.310000,okay
372,1,13,0.670000,well
372,1,13,0.410833,i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it
372,1,13,0.440000,often enough
372,1,13,0.620000,um
372,1,13,0.535000,i've tried
372,1,13,0.264545,to like go for walks but i don't always do that
372,1,13,0.178571,and i don't always stick with it
372,1,13,0.610000,<laughter>
372,1,13,0.460000,so
372,1,13,0.327500,yeah that's about it
372,1,13,0.770000,<sigh>
372,1,13,0.450000,i'd say
372,1,13,0.590000,i'm
372,1,13,0.434000,a little below average meaning
372,1,13,0.420000,that i get angry
372,1,13,0.272857,more than most people do i think
372,1,13,0.820000,hmm
372,1,13,0.335000,last night
372,1,13,0.300000,<laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband
372,1,13,0.431250,um we have my sister lives with us
372,1,13,0.287273,and she lives with us in a very small room with
372,1,13,0.251667,a small apartment i should say
372,1,13,0.331667,and she's got four people living in in one room so um
372,1,13,0.331429,it's kind of stressful it's really crowded
372,1,13,0.320000,and my husband is stressed out about it
372,1,13,0.650000,and
372,1,13,0.218750,you know i'm just saying to him that
372,1,13,0.273077,i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here
372,1,13,0.232727,then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do
372,1,13,0.286667,that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded
372,1,13,0.295000,and every day they're asking for rides and my husband
372,1,13,0.800000,he's
372,1,13,0.338750,avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore
372,1,13,0.308000,and i'm just saying that
372,1,13,0.221667,he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because
372,1,13,0.417000,he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>
372,1,13,0.270000,hmm
372,1,13,0.383333,it does <laughter>
372,1,13,0.720000,oh
372,1,13,0.232500,i've got tons of 'em but right now
372,1,13,0.474545,what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son
372,1,13,0.550000,um
372,1,13,0.410000,right now like
372,1,13,0.365000,i've been arguing with my stepmom
372,1,13,0.690000,and
372,1,13,0.400000,my stepsister for a long time about
372,1,13,0.220667,my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated
372,1,13,0.491667,like they don't have any boundaries
372,1,13,0.307143,and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child
372,1,13,0.275556,they let my child boss 'em around and stuff
372,1,13,0.502500,anyways because of this
372,1,13,0.459167,they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that
372,1,13,0.246364,yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom
372,1,13,0.269091,because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different
372,1,13,0.557500,ideas about child raising
372,1,13,0.343750,she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife
372,1,13,0.710000,and
372,1,13,0.710000,she's
372,1,13,0.347500,she really doesn't she's really far removed from
372,1,13,0.235000,how i was raised and i wanna raise my child
372,1,13,0.286452,more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us
372,1,13,0.810000,and
372,1,13,0.359444,with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild
372,1,13,0.253333,and have everything that he wants
372,1,13,0.295294,and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes
372,1,13,0.234000,and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules
372,1,13,0.365000,and not
372,1,13,0.283333,trying to go and break all of my rules
372,1,13,0.683333,<sigh> anyway <laughter>
372,1,13,0.510000,yeah
372,1,13,0.414000,um in that moment <sigh>
372,1,13,0.301111,just really frustrated because they don't listen to me
372,1,13,0.420000,i feel
372,1,13,0.633333,disrespected i feel
372,1,13,0.695000,like invisible
372,1,13,0.485000,i feel
372,1,13,0.445000,just angry
372,1,13,0.360000,that
372,1,13,0.269412,they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do
372,1,13,0.248889,i went to school and i studied child development
372,1,13,0.389286,i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>
372,1,13,0.401176,i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities
372,1,13,0.830000,and
372,1,13,0.234545,to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent
372,1,13,0.210000,try and tell me that i'm a bad parent
372,1,13,0.530000,it's really
372,1,13,0.750000,uh
372,1,13,0.308750,hard to believe so i feel very disrespected
372,1,13,0.710000,um
372,1,13,1.073333,unacknowledged angry frustrated
372,1,13,0.345000,all those things <laughter>
372,1,13,0.560000,um
372,1,13,0.223333,i take i take benadryl to help me sleep
372,1,13,0.490000,and i'm
372,1,13,0.760000,so
372,1,13,0.273913,<laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep
372,1,13,0.253333,and last night i was crying
372,1,13,0.248000,before i went to sleep
372,1,13,0.312000,so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed
372,1,13,0.222800,but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily
372,1,13,0.630000,<laughter>
372,1,13,0.308571,yeah i'm always thinking about my son
372,1,13,0.197143,how i wish he was with me
372,1,13,0.448750,and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle>
372,1,13,0.326000,and like i don't deserve
372,1,13,0.213846,to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom
372,1,13,0.265000,you know
372,1,13,0.510000,<sobbing>
372,1,13,0.300000,and i'm too hard on myself so
372,1,13,0.304667,but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom
372,1,13,0.435000,i just
372,1,13,0.265600,i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me
372,1,13,0.260909,and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because
372,1,13,0.213750,i know he can do more for him
372,1,13,0.372500,financially than i could
372,1,13,0.183333,but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom
372,1,13,1.980000,<laughter>
372,1,13,0.640000,hmm
372,1,13,0.538333,i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants

372,1,13,0.350000,my husband complains a lot he says
372,1,13,0.280000,i'm not the same person
372,1,13,0.245714,that i was when he married me

372,1,13,0.277143,i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle>

344,1,11,0.235686,and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it  
344,1,11,0.210909,and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah

344,1,11,0.231111,i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because 
344,1,11,0.244000,this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on 
344,1,11,0.262200,because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future 
344,1,11,0.135000,yeah

344,1,11,0.440000,and uh
344,1,11,0.211321,he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  
344,1,11,0.177500,excuse me ma'am

344,1,11,0.535000,that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated
344,1,11,0.288000,and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished
344,1,11,0.230000,if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it

344,1,11,0.303333,oh really and you know what i really enjoyed
344,1,11,0.388235,was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life
344,1,11,0.435000,and school was one of 'em uh 
344,1,11,0.220286,and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me 
344,1,11,0.275833,yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school
344,1,11,0.278333,and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going
344,1,11,0.270625,oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished

420,0,3,0.232857,even though we may not understand it
420,0,3,2.210000,<laughter>

420,0,3,0.197368,i know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not
420,0,3,1.110000,because
420,0,3,0.344000,when somebody talks to you
420,0,3,0.296667,when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes
420,0,3,0.252857,if you say something so many times it's what really lies in your heart
420,0,3,0.267500,<sharp inhale> so you could say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there
420,0,3,0.318000,hmm i love my daughter

420,0,3,0.366667,the hardest thing i'll probably say
420,0,3,0.560000,is
420,0,3,0.310750,scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for 'em not xxx learn the wrong lessons

383,0,7,0.458667,<laughter> i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh
383,0,7,0.435714,just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah
383,0,7,0.730000,hmm
383,0,7,0.469833,pretty good i guess i haven't
383,0,7,0.408800,yelled in a long time
383,0,7,1.031000,um
383,0,7,0.385000,well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion
383,0,7,0.228889, and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their
383,0,7,0.385000,opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was
383,0,7,0.454375,uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes
383,0,7,0.377143,things are not ready to be written
383,0,7,0.506000,yeah so yesterday
383,0,7,1.106000,hm
383,0,7,1.225000,guilty
383,0,7,0.285667,that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt
383,0,7,0.461111,what about you what's something you feel guilty about
383,0,7,0.618000,<laughter>
383,0,7,0.550000,okay
383,0,7,1.394000,mm
383,0,7,0.397125,i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just
383,0,7,0.995000,be like
383,0,7,0.286667,i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if
383,0,7,0.407500,something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah
383,0,7,0.629000,hmm
383,0,7,0.598750,um maybe the time
383,0,7,6.012000,scrubbed_entry
383,0,7,0.156375,um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just
383,0,7,0.318357,kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend
383,0,7,0.357800,and it didn't turn out
383,0,7,0.429750,you know not all
383,0,7,0.316375,nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little
383,0,7,0.290429,uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and
383,0,7,0.285227,i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up
383,0,7,0.358300,yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh
383,0,7,0.494571,maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully
383,0,7,0.661667,the hardest decision
383,0,7,0.890000,huh
383,0,7,0.607808,hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a
383,0,7,0.236333,yeah that could've been the hardest
383,0,7,0.876000,um
383,0,7,0.271400,it's just uh i don't
383,0,7,0.281838,i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that
383,0,7,0.589000,but um
383,0,7,0.398429,yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um
383,0,7,0.464000,but another reason why i
383,0,7,0.235067,decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was
383,0,7,0.307273, also because um art institute you know um that's a
383,0,7,0.425385,that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician
383,0,7,0.299200,being taught by a musician
383,0,7,0.798000,to
383,0,7,0.727500,make music
383,0,7,0.342516,and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know
383,0,7,0.531750,and it's just um
383,0,7,0.312250,yeah it's just not
383,0,7,0.598833,quite as artistic as i thought
383,0,7,0.440926,art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah
383,0,7,0.989000,hm
383,0,7,0.579500,if i
383,0,7,0.511667,if i um
383,0,7,0.366381,it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i
383,0,7,0.395556,remember to breathe and go through my mantras or
383,0,7,0.336333,remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um
383,0,7,0.409364,but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah
383,0,7,0.321459,um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice
383,0,7,0.348588,a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice
383,0,7,0.423187,pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh
383,0,7,0.492200,like chamomile and cannabis and
383,0,7,0.572091,just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju <laughter>
383,0,7,1.291000,mm
383,0,7,0.359333,mm i i guess not if i can't think of something no
383,0,7,0.711667,i've been feeling
383,0,7,0.351815,kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but it's a nice grey it's a really nice hue
383,0,7,0.428214,um some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's uh
383,0,7,0.510500,it's stable
383,0,7,0.401200,yeah it's it's comfortable yeah
383,0,7,0.745750,no no i haven't
383,0,7,0.632308,not by a certified um medical professional no but no i haven't <laughter>
383,0,7,0.947000,um
383,0,7,0.278667,yeah i mean i just think like the whole
383,0,7,0.375353,you know like you said p_t_s_d depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think
383,0,7,0.450000,everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry
383,0,7,0.247333,i think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just
383,0,7,0.391538,different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different
383,0,7,0.462500,waves different swells um so yeah i think
383,0,7,0.347500,i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats
383,0,7,0.751500,really happy
383,0,7,0.815000,um
383,0,7,0.202667,i i mean i feel really happy a lot
383,0,7,0.298067,uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess
383,0,7,0.377938,maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze
383,0,7,0.498000,biking
383,0,7,0.303000,yeah it is <laughter>
383,0,7,0.421955,um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea
383,0,7,0.512667,that maybe i'm just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess
383,0,7,0.405381,well i'm twenty one so twenty years ago <laughter> i would've told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young
383,0,7,0.469294,and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen
383,0,7,1.170000,be
383,0,7,0.325437,be a beautiful baby that's what i would've told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby
383,0,7,1.312000,mm
383,0,7,0.746000,um
383,0,7,0.402467,well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me
383,0,7,0.436333,is um my ability to work
383,0,7,0.376000,with others and i'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint i've been uh collaborating a lot with
383,0,7,0.452615,artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and
383,0,7,0.559429,i'm really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together
383,0,7,0.910000,yeah
383,0,7,0.884000,mm
383,0,7,0.445400,that's a weird question like
383,0,7,0.608000,um
383,0,7,0.274500,like that's trying to make me single out
383,0,7,0.394000,the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you

422,1,12,0.264167,i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c
422,1,12,0.330000,yeah
422,1,12,0.210000,i'm happy
422,1,12,0.350000,ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian
422,1,12,0.294189,but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and
422,1,12,0.298000,in in a veterinary capacity
422,1,12,0.180000,yeah
422,1,12,0.296842,i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and
422,1,12,0.340833,how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not
422,1,12,0.250000,yeah
422,1,12,0.680000,<laughter>
422,1,12,0.170000,<laughter>
422,1,12,0.587500,uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping
422,1,12,0.640000,um
422,1,12,0.340000,i like
422,1,12,0.336154,like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand
422,1,12,0.380909,or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or
422,1,12,0.412222,a lotta times i can just lay there and
422,1,12,0.260000,my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing
422,1,12,0.250000,ah really good
422,1,12,0.270000,i don't have
422,1,12,0.393750,i would say there's certain things that um
422,1,12,0.356667,they can really
422,1,12,0.356667,like make me
422,1,12,0.320000,like when i see injustices or things like that then
422,1,12,0.155714,i mean i can really feel it
422,1,12,0.260000,but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or
422,1,12,0.406667,uh even you know yell <laughter>
422,1,12,0.850000,<sigh>
422,1,12,1.070000,argued
422,1,12,0.805000,um <sigh>
422,1,12,0.267647,i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument
422,1,12,0.120000,like if we just
422,1,12,0.580000,well
422,1,12,0.258333,uh i would say last summer
422,1,12,0.980000,when
422,1,12,0.600000,um
422,1,12,0.193333,i think it was after a
422,1,12,0.315385,baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to
422,1,12,0.262222,we went to have shabu shabu after the game
422,1,12,0.660000,and
422,1,12,0.202000,i don't know i think
422,1,12,1.740000,scrubbed_entry
422,1,12,0.356923,and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like
422,1,12,0.239200,mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her
422,1,12,0.300000,um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any
422,1,12,0.450000,deep problems but um
422,1,12,0.617500,sometimes we just have
422,1,12,0.320000,she's very touchy
422,1,12,0.246818,and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do
422,1,12,0.180000,so i think
422,1,12,0.316471,she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm
422,1,12,0.230000,you know i just kinda
422,1,12,0.202000,that's just how she is
422,1,12,0.275000,and then i guess i said some things that she
422,1,12,0.495000,felt were
422,1,12,0.274000,eh well she gets really
422,1,12,0.287222,offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we
422,1,12,0.171538,then one day she called me up and then we were friends again
422,1,12,0.220000,but like she never she never confronted me
422,1,12,0.643333,hardest decision <sigh>
422,1,12,0.381667,uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend
422,1,12,0.605000,uh well
422,1,12,0.300000,it wasn't
422,1,12,0.570000,<sigh>
422,1,12,0.295385,it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it
422,1,12,0.312500,for like five years
422,1,12,0.650000,um
422,1,12,0.205000,you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just
422,1,12,0.242000,had a lot of um
422,1,12,0.302778,we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements
422,1,12,0.238182,so i had thought about it and thought about it and
422,1,12,0.226429,we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so
422,1,12,0.247500,i don't know uh
422,1,12,0.257143,i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally
422,1,12,0.263333,eh we were just always having
422,1,12,0.620000,um
422,1,12,0.252727,we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um
422,1,12,0.357143,we were just having these little snippy
422,1,12,0.249524,disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and
422,1,12,0.413333,um i did
422,1,12,0.350000,it was really hard it was it was the hardest
422,1,12,0.297273,decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um
422,1,12,0.790000,and
422,1,12,0.223333,but i i think it was for the best
422,1,12,0.706667,<deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job
422,1,12,0.546364,for well to help my friend start a business in nevada
422,1,12,0.226000,and when i when i
422,1,12,0.282143,i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach
422,1,12,0.278148,and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome
422,1,12,0.390000,and that was really stressful for me because um
422,1,12,0.331905,i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't
422,1,12,0.303333,for her wanting me to come over there um
422,1,12,0.272778,it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left
422,1,12,0.530000,and um
422,1,12,0.292000,when i went over there
422,1,12,0.251579,like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah
422,1,12,0.311111,when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and
422,1,12,0.322500,the other principals of the company were um
422,1,12,0.127500,you know the <th>
422,1,12,0.219615,it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much
422,1,12,0.880000,and also
422,1,12,0.284000,they were a different religion
422,1,12,0.280143,and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh
422,1,12,0.282000,eh i was kind of an outsider there and then
422,1,12,0.287273,also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>
422,1,12,0.410000,so i would say that's one decision it it's
422,1,12,0.236429,it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um
422,1,12,0.242500,i really wish i i had just stayed
422,1,12,0.384444,<laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say
422,1,12,1.010000,<sigh>
422,1,12,0.400000,my memory
422,1,12,0.227647,like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase
422,1,12,0.090000,is that what you're saying
422,1,12,0.700000,mm <sigh>
422,1,12,0.352857,can't really think of anything i mean
422,1,12,0.430000,even like that
422,1,12,0.415000,that bad decision that i made
422,1,12,0.245333,you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something
422,1,12,0.275833,and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't
422,1,12,0.242500,<sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>
422,1,12,0.268462,being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but
422,1,12,0.424286,i never feel rested and that's um
422,1,12,0.251667,it's a medical problem of mine
422,1,12,0.617500,well i always feel
422,1,12,0.288750,like i haven't slept for two days and
422,1,12,0.560000,um
422,1,12,0.332857,there are points in in the day
422,1,12,0.243043,i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and
422,1,12,0.456000,and rested but they're short-lived
422,1,12,0.248571,but i sleep a lot i sleep
422,1,12,0.475714,uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy
422,1,12,0.280000,yeah
422,1,12,0.343333,well thanks <laughter>
422,1,12,0.280000,no
422,1,12,0.360000,<sniffle>
422,1,12,0.405556,i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um
422,1,12,0.570000,that's
422,1,12,0.435000,that's usually what doctors
422,1,12,0.720000,um
422,1,12,0.300690,like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and
422,1,12,0.338824,figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep
422,1,12,0.150000,but i do
422,1,12,0.625000,<sigh> i do <sigh>
422,1,12,0.434444,i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well
422,1,12,0.321176,my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down
422,1,12,0.530000,um
422,1,12,0.298889,i would say that i do feel down sometimes
422,1,12,0.353333,a lotta times but it's not
422,1,12,0.310000,i would say
422,1,12,0.696667,it's reasonable considering
422,1,12,0.232000,the situations that i'm in
422,1,12,0.303636,uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult
422,1,12,0.465000,but um
422,1,12,0.350000,i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular
422,1,12,0.292941,oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've
422,1,12,0.230000,find some great new dish i like i mean
422,1,12,0.230000,what type of happiness are you looking for
422,1,12,0.525000,um <sigh>
422,1,12,0.540000,well
422,1,12,0.372000,i mean right now um
422,1,12,0.306923,my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week
422,1,12,0.247778,um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though
422,1,12,0.270645,we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um
422,1,12,0.280588,you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone
422,1,12,0.900000,um yesterday
422,1,12,0.300000,'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal
422,1,12,0.277561,<laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean
422,1,12,0.251250,you know there's little fun things like that
422,1,12,0.290000,<sniffle>
422,1,12,0.675000,uh <sigh>
422,1,12,1.000000,probably um
422,1,12,1.000000,o_c_d <laughter> and um
422,1,12,0.225556,she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her
422,1,12,0.690000,um
422,1,12,0.194000,i think that she would
422,1,12,0.291818,say that i have a good heart um we're very different
422,1,12,0.650000,um
422,1,12,0.380000,and probably that i'm
422,1,12,0.780000,<sigh>
422,1,12,0.431667,i should ask her <laughter> uh
422,1,12,0.240000,i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun
422,1,12,0.320000,um but
422,1,12,0.303810,she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that
422,1,12,0.850000,why um
422,1,12,0.740000,<sigh>
422,1,12,0.183750,i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now
422,1,12,0.595000,and <sigh>
422,1,12,0.355000,so i don't really
422,1,12,0.347500,tell people about them
422,1,12,0.590000,um
422,1,12,0.266000,it it's kind of a
422,1,12,0.294286,it's kind of a killjoy but also
422,1,12,0.325556,people can feel i feel that people can feel
422,1,12,0.369375,less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of
422,1,12,0.490000,um
422,1,12,0.302188,it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before
422,1,12,0.407000,even before this difficult time in my life i've been
422,1,12,0.308889,i've been a private person i don't know why
422,1,12,0.162857,i think <thi> i think a lot
422,1,12,0.245714,eh you know i'm a deep thinker
422,1,12,0.690000,and
422,1,12,0.356667,maybe it's just
422,1,12,0.270000,you know
422,1,12,0.293333,not like i feels like i feel abnormal but
422,1,12,0.540000,um
422,1,12,0.201250,maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that
422,1,12,0.331538,don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure
422,1,12,0.250000,<sniffle>
422,1,12,0.436667,ten or twenty years ago <sigh>
422,1,12,0.570000,um
422,1,12,0.324000,well one thing that i regret right now is um
422,1,12,0.279167,you know i haven't really found
422,1,12,0.930000,somebody
422,1,12,0.222727,you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder
422,1,12,0.185000,that's it
422,1,12,0.610000,um i would say <sigh>
422,1,12,0.430000,that i've perservered
422,1,12,0.292500,i'm very proud that
422,1,12,0.377857,even though i have a lot of
422,1,12,0.395000,difficulties in my life
422,1,12,0.304615,the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school

422,1,12,0.620000,and um
422,1,12,0.270000,you know it's
422,1,12,0.375000,it's kind of a
422,1,12,0.297273,if people if people knew all the problems that i have
422,1,12,0.308571,they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um

441,1,18,0.262000,because if i'm in a room with people i'm usually
441,1,18,0.245000,the first one to start talking
441,1,18,0.290000,as a matter of fact i have fish aquarium
441,1,18,0.260000,that's what
441,1,18,0.283333,keeps me calm
441,1,18,0.293333,not very good
441,1,18,0.444167,<laughter> seems like everyday i argue with somebody about something but yesterday
441,1,18,0.254286,um a lady tried to cut line
441,1,18,0.242857,in the grocery store and i politely told her i was in line and
441,1,18,0.205000,she didn't wanna move
441,1,18,0.392500, yes it has
441,1,18,0.257647,because sometimes if people don't want to move then i feel it's my place to move them
441,1,18,0.600000,hurting people physically
441,1,18,0.260000,uh if i feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me i can get very ugly
441,1,18,0.231667,i don't like that about me
441,1,18,0.730000,um
441,1,18,0.269091,i was pulled over by the police and they had uh
441,1,18,0.326667,someone with my name and they were very rude to me and
441,1,18,0.280000,i really wasn't happy with the way they treated me
441,1,18,0.580000,um
441,1,18,0.230000,how to
441,1,18,0.416667,stay calm when
441,1,18,0.320000,someone has
441,1,18,0.338000,crossed over into my boundary
441,1,18,0.350000,my personal space
441,1,18,0.255625,i can't let people get too close to me if they do i i lash out
441,1,18,0.337778,i don't want anybody in my  area of
441,1,18,0.453333,protection i guess
441,1,18,0.290000,stay away from people
441,1,18,0.790000,<laughter>
441,1,18,0.356667,stay away from
441,1,18,0.216364,it's hard you can't live in this world without other people
441,1,18,0.231111,sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me
441,1,18,0.235833,being assaulted in the military is something i wish i could forget
441,1,18,0.217500,just that i felt
441,1,18,0.420000,helpless alone ashamed and angry
441,1,18,0.260000,that's about all i wanna go into
441,1,18,0.550000,eighteen
441,1,18,0.270000,yeah
441,1,18,0.250000,very young
441,1,18,0.350000,no
441,1,18,0.366000,because i was assaulted and
441,1,18,0.428333,and i have a fear of
441,1,18,0.406667,people in uniform
441,1,18,0.317143,like the policemen hurting me or um
441,1,18,0.570000,other military veterans
441,1,18,0.282500,hurting me when they
441,1,18,0.410000,explode or go off or
441,1,18,0.493333,have issues of
441,1,18,0.750000,p_t_s_d
441,1,18,0.440000,i can't remember
441,1,18,0.226667,i worked for the federal government
441,1,18,0.281111,well it just seemed like a normal progression um
441,1,18,0.283750,federal government gives you ten points preference over other people for being in the military so
441,1,18,0.218333,it seemed like a natural choice
441,1,18,0.251667,a organization that had a book of rules and they followed them
441,1,18,0.281667,the government one government to another
441,1,18,0.540000,yes
441,1,18,0.237143,well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given um
441,1,18,0.178571,you're told to handle it handle it
441,1,18,0.237143,and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and
441,1,18,0.260000,different people to talk to to get something done
441,1,18,0.463333,administration of justice
441,1,18,0.285000,no um i don't work anymore

441,1,18,0.310000,almost two years
441,1,18,0.270000,the feeling that i was
441,1,18,0.313636,always gonna be hurt that someone was out to get me
441,1,18,0.444000,i had nightmares panic attacks
441,1,18,0.690000,anxiety attacks

441,1,18,0.291429,and i always wanted to hit somebody
441,1,18,0.318125,yes mostly disrespect but i feel it's disrespect of people getting too close to me or
441,1,18,0.267778,i feel in fear of them for some reason
441,1,18,0.187500,i can't remember the last time i had a good night's sleep
441,1,18,0.380000,what

441,1,18,0.224000,wanting to be left alone

478,0,1,0.683333,uh let's see
478,0,1,0.962000,um
478,0,1,0.249400,well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and it's about
478,0,1,0.620000,uh
478,0,1,0.245280,a woman's relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book
478,0,1,0.302000,mhm
478,0,1,0.650000,um
478,0,1,0.291786,i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places
478,0,1,0.396667,and and do a bit of cleaning and um
478,0,1,0.715000,uh just uh relax
478,0,1,0.620000,oh
478,0,1,0.249000,yeah i would <wou> i would say um
478,0,1,0.359600,to have better self-esteem 'cause i used to have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so um
478,0,1,0.287692,you know i i wish i'd been happier <ha> happier in the past and you know it's taken me a long time to become happy because
478,0,1,0.271400,um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with
478,0,1,0.199375,being depressed i didn't <di> i didn't even know why and now you know i realize
478,0,1,0.262105,because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so
478,0,1,0.336375,i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um
478,0,1,0.414000,is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship
478,0,1,0.730000,um

446,0,0,0.361333,well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um
446,0,0,0.350000,i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going
446,0,0,0.295000,so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses

446,0,0,0.240286,so it's something that i'm willing to
446,0,0,0.192500,i'm willing to do
446,0,0,0.655000,um
446,0,0,0.263632,a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um
446,0,0,0.416667,and and outgoing as well um
446,0,0,0.200000,but i think a little bit of both i would say
446,0,0,0.440000,<laughter>
446,0,0,0.660000,uh i meditate
446,0,0,0.385909,i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating

446,0,0,0.328750,very good at controlling my temper i um
446,0,0,0.650000,again um
446,0,0,0.313333,a series of
446,0,0,0.400000,meditation that i do um
446,0,0,0.527333,it involves deep breathing and um
446,0,0,0.495000,just really centering yourself
446,0,0,0.265273,to where you can feel your heart beat and you can
446,0,0,0.419571,um really feel everything in your body
446,0,0,0.415357,and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger
446,0,0,0.213636,and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot
446,0,0,0.368000,oh wow
446,0,0,0.522857,it was just recently um actually unfortunately
446,0,0,0.272000,it was last week and it was with my husband
446,0,0,0.745500,and um
446,0,0,0.555000,it was about um
446,0,0,0.406750,just the way he responds sometimes to me
446,0,0,0.370000,uh it can be a little aggressive
446,0,0,0.389875,um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression
446,0,0,0.453636,i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so
446,0,0,0.277500,yeah that was it
446,0,0,0.350000,i felt
446,0,0,0.622500,very frustrated
446,0,0,0.467000,um and i actually felt angered too um
446,0,0,0.342214,but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so
446,0,0,0.220833,it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time
446,0,0,0.500000,uh <sigh>
446,0,0,0.387889,a situation which i wish i would've handled differently
446,0,0,0.396667,honestly i haven't had a situation like that in
446,0,0,0.358571,in years i've pretty much kind of
446,0,0,0.391000,um
446,0,0,0.370000,you know kind of mastered
446,0,0,0.612000,my responses um
446,0,0,0.354667,to certain um
446,0,0,0.818000,stimuli
446,0,0,0.218600,i've kinda got that down
446,0,0,0.347500,the hardest decision i've ever had to make
446,0,0,0.301214,well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage
446,0,0,0.396000,um mother
446,0,0,0.321667,i was pregnant at sixteen and
446,0,0,0.529500,um i had um
446,0,0,0.347500,a lot of pressure from family to um
446,0,0,0.266250,give my child up for adoption or to
446,0,0,0.373000,um abort
446,0,0,0.391429,and i chose life so that was
446,0,0,0.282789,that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old
446,0,0,0.344250,teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager
446,0,0,0.329158,or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so
446,0,0,0.370000,that i think was the hardest decision
446,0,0,0.172500,i had to make
446,0,0,0.472000,um
446,0,0,0.327267,well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later
446,0,0,0.270900,and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by
446,0,0,0.355000,not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life
446,0,0,0.597750,pro-choice pro-life and um
446,0,0,0.281214,eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and
446,0,0,0.242000,i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom
446,0,0,0.245333,i do yeah
446,0,0,0.490000,um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties
446,0,0,0.275000,um just as anything
446,0,0,0.540000,um
446,0,0,0.252727,but at the end of the day it is really rewarding
446,0,0,0.490000,um
446,0,0,0.280556,and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised
446,0,0,0.352900,become a productive citizen and go out into society and
446,0,0,0.295833,just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is
446,0,0,0.330000,oh wow
446,0,0,0.375000,so many ways um
446,0,0,0.342389,the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um
446,0,0,0.251556,accept his feedback even if i don't like it
446,0,0,0.396667,and i um allow him to express his self
446,0,0,0.414286,fortunately unfortunately when i was little um
446,0,0,0.387917,there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child
446,0,0,0.222222,um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it
446,0,0,0.386313,um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self
446,0,0,0.329138,i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age
446,0,0,0.337333,and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um
446,0,0,0.296667,make sure that you nurture that um because that's
446,0,0,0.318333,kind of um
446,0,0,0.288846,the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so
446,0,0,0.276667,i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite
446,0,0,0.335000,thank you
446,0,0,0.575000,um <sigh>
446,0,0,0.510000,well
446,0,0,0.295630,it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up
446,0,0,0.273158,so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that
446,0,0,0.281429,it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away
446,0,0,0.279778,and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so
446,0,0,0.415000,it varies
446,0,0,0.300909,i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um
446,0,0,0.263478,i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but
446,0,0,0.278778,other than that i i've been feeling really good
446,0,0,0.242667,no i haven't
446,0,0,0.175000,no i have not
446,0,0,0.282500,you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up
446,0,0,0.523333,i'm happy because
446,0,0,0.307143,that is a chance for me to
446,0,0,0.387143,take advantage carpe diem seize the day
446,0,0,0.298750,so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because
446,0,0,0.263667,i realize that some people did not wake up
446,0,0,0.398500,some people are homeless some people
446,0,0,0.363600,are going through so many situations that are really disheartening
446,0,0,0.372000,and that's not me so
446,0,0,0.334000,i feel really really blessed
446,0,0,0.245000,every day

446,0,0,0.845000,um
446,0,0,0.345467,well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree
446,0,0,0.292636,and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable
446,0,0,0.390000,in certain subjects
446,0,0,0.320000,and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things
446,0,0,0.300000,and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert
446,0,0,0.422500,you know what no regrets no regrets um
446,0,0,0.312500,you live and learn um nothing is perfect
446,0,0,0.258667,um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today

375,0,5,0.331667,it's good but sometimes they're just
375,0,5,0.236667,they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings
375,0,5,0.226667,like with my brother he's just
375,0,5,0.242778,he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush <br> brush it off on me

404,0,0,0.342857,i view spent some time in a
404,0,0,0.458889,many waiting rooms where there's been fishtanks and uh
404,0,0,0.397000,uh so staring at fishtanks could be one of them
404,0,0,0.404286,uh but i also enjoy walking or
404,0,0,0.387692,uh lifting weights reading going to movies just to say a few things
404,0,0,0.740000,uh good
404,0,0,0.615000,moderate uh good um
404,0,0,0.380000,in control

404,0,0,0.242000,just before i got here
404,0,0,0.806667,and it was
404,0,0,1.730000,about um

404,0,0,0.584000,how uh making an arrangement
404,0,0,1.086667,feel guilty about
404,0,0,0.411429,not taking better care of my pet
404,0,0,0.346154,sure i i like birds so one of my pets was a bird
404,0,0,0.360000,uh as of recently
404,0,0,1.220000,and
404,0,0,0.900000,i
404,0,0,0.325714,let my bird out into the wild
404,0,0,0.790000,and
404,0,0,0.421250,sort of wish i had planned for better
404,0,0,0.540000,um
404,0,0,0.330000,future for the for the bird
404,0,0,0.408000,uh only because now i sort of wish the bird
404,0,0,0.644000,was uh closer to me
404,0,0,0.710000,hm
404,0,0,0.443333,i would say
404,0,0,0.440000,i get into arguments with people close to me friends
404,0,0,0.810000,and
404,0,0,0.402857,sometimes i i don't handle them well
404,0,0,0.700000,i am more
404,0,0,1.390000,reactive
404,0,0,0.315000,so i wish uh i'd like to see myself improve on that
404,0,0,0.865000,uh no
404,0,0,0.295714,um at least not you know in any sort of legal trouble but uh
404,0,0,0.285000,i think it's you know it's kind of
404,0,0,0.240000,not the way that i would like to have handled it
404,0,0,0.761429,guess the hardest decision was about to
404,0,0,0.610000,of
404,0,0,0.625000,how to
404,0,0,0.970000,proceed with
404,0,0,0.672500,moving forward eh on
404,0,0,0.540000,a
404,0,0,0.825000,job opportunity
404,0,0,0.376667,i had to
404,0,0,0.855000,decide whether
404,0,0,0.350000,if i would
404,0,0,0.688333,suffer more emotional pain by leaving
404,0,0,0.627500,my family and whether the financial gain and
404,0,0,0.865000,uh knowledge
404,0,0,0.685000,of that experience would over outweigh the benefit
404,0,0,0.580000,uh yes yes i am
404,0,0,0.402500,well i it's a small family but um
404,0,0,0.454000,have a mother and a
404,0,0,0.406000,uh sister and a brother
404,0,0,0.518000,and uh two younger nieces
404,0,0,0.522000,older they're they're grown adults
404,0,0,0.478571,uh it's a it's a good relationship
404,0,0,1.320000,and
404,0,0,0.760000,uh
404,0,0,0.320000,things could be better
404,0,0,0.620000,um sometimes it's sort of difficult pain
404,0,0,0.740000,staking
404,0,0,0.520000,uh relationship at times
404,0,0,0.648000,there's uh some days i'm
404,0,0,0.412857,i need time for myself and i
404,0,0,0.393333,would rather give the time to
404,0,0,0.353571,other people rather than to take time for myself which has been my experience
404,0,0,0.646667,uh and so
404,0,0,0.413636,that has caused me a lot me a lot of emotional
404,0,0,0.354286,pain uh a little bit of spiritual
404,0,0,0.397143,uh anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing
404,0,0,0.326667,wow there's so many things <laughter> what about you i don't know anything about you
404,0,0,0.470000,i would say uh well there's there's a few um
404,0,0,0.374000,but of recent i um
404,0,0,0.600000,well
404,0,0,0.388333,things are going pretty good i'm
404,0,0,0.314231,can't really say there's anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on that i can remember
404,0,0,0.302500,it's been pretty good
404,0,0,0.580000,and uh
404,0,0,0.362857,it's uh i'd say it's okay uh
404,0,0,0.331667,i'm handling my sleep pretty well
404,0,0,0.327273,when i don't sleep well sometimes i can be irritable um
404,0,0,0.680000,sometimes it's okay uh
404,0,0,0.470000,and uh would say if
404,0,0,0.516000,there's also times where i'm
404,0,0,0.810000,unhappy
404,0,0,0.680000,so
404,0,0,0.293333,i try to
404,0,0,0.251429,get as much sleep as i need
404,0,0,0.710000,yes

404,0,0,0.756667,um well uh
404,0,0,0.293077,i guess i suppose it made me a more confident person and more
404,0,0,0.850000,um
404,0,0,0.555000,in tune with uh
404,0,0,0.461111,uh the country that i'm living in and people
404,0,0,0.690000,uh
404,0,0,0.332000,to be more noticeable more watchful of where i live

448,1,18,1.030000,<sync>
448,1,18,0.550000,yes
448,1,18,0.280000,doing pretty good
448,1,18,0.235294,oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven
448,1,18,0.284286,and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a
448,1,18,0.540000,californian <laughter>
448,1,18,0.230000,uh i'm a welder
448,1,18,0.820000,um
448,1,18,0.570000,i just
448,1,18,0.338000,i don't know something about
448,1,18,0.448000,it making and um building things and repairing things that
448,1,18,0.363333,intrigued me and
448,1,18,0.228421,uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession
448,1,18,0.456667,<sigh> gee i really never had that i've just
448,1,18,0.300909,uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh
448,1,18,0.248000,i was satisfied with that
448,1,18,0.343684,well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old
448,1,18,0.510000,and uh
448,1,18,0.243000,other than my wife i don't have any more family
448,1,18,0.441429,um he passed away last uh july
448,1,18,0.463333,and uh i'm
448,1,18,0.228000,starting to get over it
448,1,18,0.280000,um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so
448,1,18,0.337143,i've been depressed about that and uh
448,1,18,0.198000,uh but i'm doing better
448,1,18,0.395000,it depends on the atmosphere um
448,1,18,0.326364,if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm
448,1,18,0.550000,kinda reserved
448,1,18,0.320000,but uh
448,1,18,0.336667,if i'm comfortable
448,1,18,0.430000,and uh
448,1,18,0.266667,i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing
448,1,18,0.950000,<laughter>
448,1,18,0.390000,<laughter>
448,1,18,0.280000,right
448,1,18,0.403667,i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and
448,1,18,0.275000,i try to pick a movie that's uh
448,1,18,0.353750,from back then people were different than they
448,1,18,0.231538,uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it
448,1,18,0.720000,<sigh> well
448,1,18,0.314667,my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but
448,1,18,0.312000,uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper
448,1,18,0.315625,and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about
448,1,18,0.400000,but um
448,1,18,0.370000,i'm working on it and
448,1,18,0.520000,uh
448,1,18,0.276923,i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child
448,1,18,0.363333,oh yes <laughter>
448,1,18,0.259200,uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh
448,1,18,0.304000,<sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter
448,1,18,0.275385,but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young
448,1,18,0.252000,uh follows you for the rest of your life and
448,1,18,0.282105,i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices
448,1,18,0.323333,uh me and my wife we
448,1,18,0.397500,we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree
448,1,18,0.520000,and it's
448,1,18,0.319310,she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh
448,1,18,0.375000,uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is
448,1,18,0.394286,a determined strong willed woman and <sniff>
448,1,18,0.253333,i am who i am so
448,1,18,0.337143,we kinda go back and forth and
448,1,18,0.327500,lately i have been the one to <sigh>
448,1,18,0.384211,bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run
448,1,18,0.239231,it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me
448,1,18,0.397619,um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed
448,1,18,0.244118,and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and
448,1,18,0.451000,having an ego bigger than my common sense and um
448,1,18,0.282857,that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh
448,1,18,0.394545,i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um
448,1,18,0.302500,getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but
448,1,18,0.248571,when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and
448,1,18,0.360000,<sniff>
448,1,18,0.222083,if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so
448,1,18,0.530000,i
448,1,18,0.332500,you know ran where
448,1,18,0.230909,people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble
448,1,18,0.311250,hardest decision i ever had to make was
448,1,18,0.540000,giving the authorization to
448,1,18,1.060000,um
448,1,18,0.358667,have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed
448,1,18,0.483333,<sigh> and um
448,1,18,0.211429,doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him
448,1,18,0.436000,<sigh> go through any suffering
448,1,18,0.430000,to
448,1,18,0.272500,let him slip away
448,1,18,0.252727,and as you can see i get very upset my uncle
448,1,18,0.278571,raised me like his own son and
448,1,18,0.227500,never let me down
448,1,18,0.490000,<sniff> and he's gone and
448,1,18,0.206000,for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff>
448,1,18,0.240000,but as i said i'm getting over it and um
448,1,18,0.316000,things are getting better slowly
448,1,18,0.363333,my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself
448,1,18,0.582500,um <coughs> we enjoy
448,1,18,0.358000,uh uh doing simple things
448,1,18,0.307391,it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company
448,1,18,0.362222,uh we like the same things and uh we
448,1,18,0.273636,you know occasionally go out and do something together but we
448,1,18,0.240000,<clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she
448,1,18,0.311429,like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes
448,1,18,0.320000,mhm
448,1,18,0.300000,you know
448,1,18,0.810000,<sigh>
448,1,18,1.150000,lately
448,1,18,0.300625,well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do
448,1,18,0.535000,a rigorous activity or something that
448,1,18,0.506250,really uh stresses me or strains my body
448,1,18,0.290000,it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much
448,1,18,0.323846,i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours
448,1,18,0.218333,i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but
448,1,18,0.259048,i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep
448,1,18,0.286667,i'll stay up all day and
448,1,18,0.292500,i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but
448,1,18,0.302000,you know for me i'm
448,1,18,0.227500,it doesn't affect me
448,1,18,0.328125,<sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um
448,1,18,0.275143,uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life
448,1,18,0.360000,but um <sniff>
448,1,18,0.275000,i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content
448,1,18,0.381111,yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um
448,1,18,0.343636,recently well i can't say recently this was back in january
448,1,18,0.460000,um
448,1,18,0.460000,my wife and a few uh friends were
448,1,18,0.524000,noticing that i was um
448,1,18,0.445000,becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things
448,1,18,0.341429,i i didn't see it and um
448,1,18,0.226667,you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to
448,1,18,0.315556,but anyway i went to the doctor and um
448,1,18,0.282000,they gave me the tests
448,1,18,0.427500,and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh
448,1,18,0.520000,i've
448,1,18,0.445000,over the last month or so
448,1,18,0.299231,nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but
448,1,18,0.310000,the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me
448,1,18,0.286957,um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but
448,1,18,0.430909,um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh
448,1,18,0.278182,it it could've been due also i was told by him
448,1,18,0.520000,uh
448,1,18,0.284500,because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and
448,1,18,0.320000,so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better
448,1,18,0.355000,i'm sorry

448,1,18,0.324000,i was in a um
448,1,18,0.275714,in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help
448,1,18,0.397000,um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder
448,1,18,0.323333,uh worrying and thinking too much about things and
448,1,18,0.351667,uh thinking the worst and uh
448,1,18,0.225000,i i take medication for that
448,1,18,0.234545,uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's
448,1,18,0.289333,<clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor
448,1,18,0.309333,are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter>
448,1,18,0.290952,it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so
448,1,18,0.274286,it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that

448,1,18,1.170000,<sigh>
448,1,18,0.350000,last time i felt real happy
448,1,18,0.221346,well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um
448,1,18,0.288667,i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff>

448,1,18,0.277391,i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content
448,1,18,0.340000,i'm not
448,1,18,0.610000,um
448,1,18,0.398500,i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so

448,1,18,0.269000,well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>
448,1,18,0.440000,she would um
448,1,18,0.590000,describe me as uh
448,1,18,0.285000,i don't think before i speak
448,1,18,0.743333,um i um
448,1,18,0.770000,let the littlest insignificant things
448,1,18,0.388571,bother me and i get angry over
448,1,18,0.380000,but the big things it's like
448,1,18,0.420909,i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um
448,1,18,0.374286,uh <vocal fry> years and years ago
448,1,18,0.380000,um
448,1,18,0.334444,she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender
448,1,18,0.195882,and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby
448,1,18,0.456667,and i <sigh>
448,1,18,0.256667,you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought
448,1,18,0.260870,<laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby
448,1,18,0.297143,and uh she goes you know you
448,1,18,0.338276,you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money
448,1,18,0.305455,you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care
448,1,18,0.250000,so
448,1,18,0.158750,that's the only way i can explain it
448,1,18,0.303333,well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle
448,1,18,0.540000,um
448,1,18,0.240000,i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life
448,1,18,0.251250,and i'm finding it a little bit harder
448,1,18,0.407692,um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power
448,1,18,0.296154,to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or
448,1,18,0.255455,you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were
448,1,18,0.237778,a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a
448,1,18,10.500000,scrubbed_entry
448,1,18,0.240000,uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more
448,1,18,0.269000,i guess it's we're a little bit older now and
448,1,18,0.252692,<laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh
448,1,18,0.306364,i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh>
448,1,18,0.670000,<sigh> uh lately
448,1,18,0.346250,no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff>
448,1,18,0.347500,everything's been fine the
448,1,18,0.320000,like i say the
448,1,18,0.515000,the biggest
448,1,18,0.353750,biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever
448,1,18,0.349000,in a hundred years or ever thought that i would
448,1,18,0.280000,face that
448,1,18,0.481250,situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but
448,1,18,0.329091,they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter>
448,1,18,0.260000,don't listen to other people
448,1,18,0.640000,uh
448,1,18,0.288333,again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh
448,1,18,0.255143,he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they
448,1,18,0.228462,um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think
448,1,18,0.324211,they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems
448,1,18,0.670000,um
448,1,18,0.293750,i wish i could've changed some things um
448,1,18,0.323333,<coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody
448,1,18,0.289524,and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do
448,1,18,0.228333,uh i don't miss them but
448,1,18,0.249524,if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made
448,1,18,0.450000,my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff>
448,1,18,0.353889,uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat>
448,1,18,0.265556,uh people that i know say that i'm uh
448,1,18,0.349474,well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh
448,1,18,0.384545,restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but
448,1,18,0.247500,i've been told that
448,1,18,0.321250,once or twice but i i've kind of
448,1,18,0.270952,i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but
448,1,18,0.282500,i just don't feel the motivation no more
448,1,18,0.256000,i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>
448,1,18,0.360000,okay
448,1,18,0.230000,well thank you
448,1,18,0.170000,bye bye
386,1,11,0.860000,<synch>
386,1,11,0.600000,yes
386,1,11,0.326000,oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter>
386,1,11,0.274000,i was born in canada
386,1,11,0.302727,and but i've lived in california most of my life so
386,1,11,0.286250,and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish
386,1,11,0.370000,the <laughter>
386,1,11,0.282857,oh my gosh years and years ago
386,1,11,0.301250,uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time
386,1,11,0.300500,well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so
386,1,11,0.310714,travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so
386,1,11,0.225000,uh huh
386,1,11,0.360882,oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that
386,1,11,0.339000,it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and
386,1,11,0.244545,but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with
386,1,11,0.200000,so
386,1,11,0.270000,mhm
386,1,11,0.319048,why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and
386,1,11,0.301429,this became our home base and uh
386,1,11,0.355000,that's why
386,1,11,0.495000,easy very easy so
386,1,11,0.155000,uh huh
386,1,11,0.407000,uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that
386,1,11,0.273529,went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter>
386,1,11,0.399091,and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so
386,1,11,0.620000,um
386,1,11,0.233333,i don't know
386,1,11,0.332000,can't really pinpoint why <laughter>
386,1,11,0.250000,so
386,1,11,0.342632,i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate
386,1,11,0.321667,i'm a leasing consultant part time
386,1,11,0.350000,i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives
386,1,11,0.420000,oh
386,1,11,0.412222,probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at
386,1,11,0.298571,t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>
386,1,11,0.291176,but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so
386,1,11,0.323125,but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals
386,1,11,0.480000,so
386,1,11,0.307368,i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet
386,1,11,0.272000,you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social
386,1,11,0.330000,<laughter>
386,1,11,0.260000,<laughter>
386,1,11,1.310000,<laughter>
386,1,11,0.301154,oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um
386,1,11,0.397143,take a walk uh call my friends
386,1,11,0.345000,million things <laughter> so
386,1,11,0.272632,i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody
386,1,11,0.286061,cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so
386,1,11,0.370000,mhm
386,1,11,0.480000,mm
386,1,11,0.352500,i can't really remember
386,1,11,0.341818,so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i
386,1,11,0.428571,avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so
386,1,11,0.253750,i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of
386,1,11,0.690000,mm
386,1,11,0.232857,i can't think of anything right now
386,1,11,0.230000,i
386,1,11,0.320909,really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard
386,1,11,0.241538,i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision
386,1,11,0.211071,so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but
386,1,11,0.296667,since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and
386,1,11,0.279474,that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider
386,1,11,0.210000,mm
386,1,11,0.270000,yeah
386,1,11,0.265000,an event
386,1,11,0.470000,hmm
386,1,11,0.289048,well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever
386,1,11,0.229091,so i know when my father died you know i mean
386,1,11,0.202059,i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more
386,1,11,0.250000,but
386,1,11,0.305714,you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with
386,1,11,0.280000,that
386,1,11,0.350000,so
386,1,11,0.330000,mhm
386,1,11,0.418000,yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh
386,1,11,0.389231,philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives
386,1,11,0.470000,so
386,1,11,0.258519,well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do
386,1,11,0.260476,um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot
386,1,11,0.243333,i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them
386,1,11,0.500000,so
386,1,11,0.266667,mhm we have a small family
386,1,11,0.325333,uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many
386,1,11,0.241429,types of kids out there i think
386,1,11,0.285652,majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control
386,1,11,0.385000,but um
386,1,11,0.290909,i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very
386,1,11,0.440000,well-behaved so can't say much else about that
386,1,11,0.298500,well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um
386,1,11,0.280833,uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but
386,1,11,0.324000,they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes
386,1,11,0.296190,run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't
386,1,11,0.297692,yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting
386,1,11,0.299500,ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll
386,1,11,0.236667,kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so
386,1,11,0.342308,i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>
386,1,11,0.222000,but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of
386,1,11,0.165000,you know
386,1,11,0.355556,taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's
386,1,11,0.227500,i can't say anything to her about that
386,1,11,0.270000,so
386,1,11,0.261765,yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know
386,1,11,0.288000,at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but
386,1,11,0.302000,for now you know that's i'll deal with it so
386,1,11,0.319767,tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but
386,1,11,0.380000,the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so
386,1,11,0.279259,you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
386,1,11,0.260000,mhm
386,1,11,0.381111,uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm
386,1,11,0.262000,i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean
386,1,11,0.275556,so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that
386,1,11,0.515000,i um
386,1,11,0.261818,i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know
386,1,11,0.315000,whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of
386,1,11,0.411250,creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies
386,1,11,0.600000,and
386,1,11,0.251053,you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so
386,1,11,0.323333,no mm mm
386,1,11,0.450000,no
386,1,11,0.231538,i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person
386,1,11,0.233214,and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so
386,1,11,1.380000,hmm
386,1,11,0.990000,<laughter>
386,1,11,0.322083,can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so
386,1,11,0.394000,no i never regret anything
386,1,11,0.200000,uh huh
386,1,11,0.277368,what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it
386,1,11,0.457500,everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um
386,1,11,0.402000,you know seems like <laughter>
386,1,11,0.475833,uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um
386,1,11,0.523333,wasted time with certain people um
386,1,11,0.231818,i don't know those are the things that come to mind
386,1,11,0.372727,maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things
386,1,11,0.500000,but
386,1,11,0.160000,mm
386,1,11,0.350000,outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh
386,1,11,0.237692,i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so
386,1,11,0.320000,mhm
386,1,11,0.254000,well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but
386,1,11,0.309412,i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and
386,1,11,0.292500,um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we
386,1,11,0.221935,you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so
386,1,11,0.266562,that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah
386,1,11,0.290000,mhm
386,1,11,0.289000,i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>
386,1,11,0.308889,but uh if you want i'll repeat it so
386,1,11,0.313750,um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable
386,1,11,0.640000,uh
386,1,11,0.467000,i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener
386,1,11,0.241379,and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm
386,1,11,0.193333,don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so
386,1,11,0.640000,hmm
386,1,11,0.350000,that's a hard question <laughter> the
386,1,11,0.260000,can't think i mean i'm
386,1,11,0.281000,can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>
386,1,11,0.325333,for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um
386,1,11,0.274286,i love going out with my friends
386,1,11,0.579091,shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips
386,1,11,0.780000,um
386,1,11,0.376667,that's kind of
386,1,11,0.140000,you know
386,1,11,0.232500,part of it yeah that i mentioned so
386,1,11,0.446364,traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it
386,1,11,0.505000,um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries
386,1,11,0.593333,uh the architecture
386,1,11,0.306154,it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place
386,1,11,0.400000,mhm
386,1,11,0.541667,okay well <laughter> i've um been
386,1,11,0.341667,to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can
386,1,11,0.305652,whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um
386,1,11,0.316250,each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are
386,1,11,0.415455,there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um
386,1,11,0.418000,kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international
386,1,11,0.286944,and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's
386,1,11,0.253846,but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so
386,1,11,0.190000,uh
386,1,11,0.305263,yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college
386,1,11,0.237273,that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and
386,1,11,0.373929,um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um
386,1,11,0.530000,so yeah that's
386,1,11,0.250000,mhm
386,1,11,0.110000,yeah
386,1,11,0.320000,<laughter>
386,1,11,0.370000,mhm

416,0,3,0.650000,chicago
416,0,3,0.270000,yeah
416,0,3,0.364000,about twenty five years ago
416,0,3,0.198000,yeah it's been a while
416,0,3,0.282222,actually i haven't been back <laughter> i like l_a
416,0,3,0.273333,i like l_a
416,0,3,0.279565,mm it's a big city so it's kinda similar but the weather is not the same so gotta love l_a for the weather
416,0,3,0.213333,<tisk> family i was a child
416,0,3,0.253750,it took a little adjustment but not hard
416,0,3,0.710000,um the weather
416,0,3,1.120000,um
416,0,3,0.212069,i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave
416,0,3,0.830000,traffic <laughter>
416,0,3,0.246364,not really but i've traveled <tra> traveled a little bit yeah
416,0,3,0.269091,seeing new places different people the way they live their lives
416,0,3,0.457500,<tisk> um i went to monterey california earlier
416,0,3,0.201667,last <la> or the middle of last year that was very nice
416,0,3,1.240000,um
416,0,3,0.210000,it's a good question
416,0,3,0.367500,i'm not really sure
416,0,3,0.306667,uh there's probably
416,0,3,0.194211,i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter>
416,0,3,0.680000,astronomy
416,0,3,0.216667,yeah it was
416,0,3,0.246538,<tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path
416,0,3,0.550000,no
416,0,3,0.465000,there's not much job opportunities so
416,0,3,0.306667,it's kinda limited
416,0,3,0.292500,yeah it does <laughter>
416,0,3,0.695000,um my dream job
416,0,3,0.522000,i would like to own
416,0,3,0.400000,a restaurant
416,0,3,0.312000,a nice a bar restaurant
416,0,3,0.282727,well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than
416,0,3,0.292000,most places you go to
416,0,3,0.210000,or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of
416,0,3,0.314000,worn out run down so
416,0,3,0.340000,something nice something different something creative
416,0,3,0.304444,something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd
416,0,3,0.245000,but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible
416,0,3,0.420000,<laughter>
416,0,3,0.332500,i'm definitely more shy
416,0,3,0.240000,but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but
416,0,3,0.317500,initially i'm pretty shy
416,0,3,0.450000,<laughter>
416,0,3,0.265000,good idea
416,0,3,0.211667,um a lot of times i
416,0,3,0.203333,try to just
416,0,3,0.293333,lay back and you know do some deep breathing
416,0,3,0.270000,just kind of clear your mind
416,0,3,0.256429,or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book
416,0,3,0.255000,kinda just takes your mind away
416,0,3,0.490000,relax
416,0,3,0.240370,i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now
416,0,3,0.410000,learned that you shouldn't
416,0,3,0.510000,react immediately to situations you should
416,0,3,0.205000,you know think before you speak that type of thing
416,0,3,0.352500,um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago
416,0,3,0.240000,<laughter>
416,0,3,0.720000,um
416,0,3,0.299310,we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and
416,0,3,0.268621,wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so
416,0,3,0.272500,i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate
416,0,3,1.070000,frustrated
416,0,3,0.250000,like
416,0,3,0.376667,yeah i guess
416,0,3,0.277188,everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that
416,0,3,0.210000,you know
416,0,3,0.287000,of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves
416,0,3,0.230000,<tisk> but yeah
416,0,3,0.297407,mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion
416,0,3,0.258095,um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know
416,0,3,0.288462,or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh
416,0,3,0.247059,you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or
416,0,3,0.187500,that type of thing
416,0,3,0.553333,<tisk> um <sigh>
416,0,3,0.278333,leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago
416,0,3,0.278889,i went to school in san diego and i
416,0,3,0.313333,immediately wanted to come back so
416,0,3,0.245294,i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that
416,0,3,1.030000,mm
416,0,3,0.277857,i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i
416,0,3,0.275000,i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so
416,0,3,0.229310,employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others
416,0,3,0.180000,so not be so much of a burden to people around me
416,0,3,0.396000,<tisk> yeah real difficult <laughter>
416,0,3,0.295000,it's good
416,0,3,0.200000,it's very good
416,0,3,0.256316,we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so
416,0,3,0.195455,it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well
416,0,3,0.220000,could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good
416,0,3,0.251429,<tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper
416,0,3,0.615000,um probably irritable there's
416,0,3,0.284000,it's harder to do tasks
416,0,3,0.233500,it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and
416,0,3,0.390000,good
416,0,3,0.470000,relatively well
416,0,3,0.292857,spring time always makes everybody feel well
416,0,3,0.250000,no not at all
416,0,3,0.500000,never
416,0,3,0.384583,<tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while
416,0,3,0.225714,um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy
416,0,3,0.528000,i wish i was more
416,0,3,0.430000,i guess
416,0,3,0.303810,stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less
416,0,3,0.480000,so
416,0,3,0.226667,i don't know
416,0,3,0.195000,i i guess that's
416,0,3,0.289091,the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter>
416,0,3,0.249231,don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something
416,0,3,0.220000,um i'm just gonna stick to that
416,0,3,0.308667,argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter>
416,0,3,1.650000,um
416,0,3,0.590000,i
416,0,3,0.364286,i don't know uh when i was
416,0,3,0.265333,when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and
416,0,3,0.560000,i drove
416,0,3,0.222222,my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that
416,0,3,0.220000,but
416,0,3,0.245385,that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter>
416,0,3,0.680000,stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>
416,0,3,0.256190,<tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends
416,0,3,0.392500,that've been positive influences
416,0,3,0.390000,yeah
416,0,3,0.932500,mm a caring guy
416,0,3,0.545000,nice person good heart
416,0,3,0.345000,a little
416,0,3,0.428462,a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to
416,0,3,0.557500,make himself better and
416,0,3,0.300833,uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter>
416,0,3,0.410000,<laughter>
416,0,3,0.292000,well i care a lot and at the same time
416,0,3,0.198571,sometimes it gets the best of me
416,0,3,1.220000,mm
416,0,3,0.321765,<tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that
416,0,3,0.345000,you're doing more than
416,0,3,0.322222,they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated
416,0,3,0.362500,so that's an example
416,0,3,0.230000,yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head
416,0,3,0.595000,<tisk> um
416,0,3,0.380000,focus more on school
416,0,3,0.353333,because while you're young you have the ability to
416,0,3,0.890000,multitask
416,0,3,0.890000,and
416,0,3,8.420000,scrubbed_entry
416,0,3,1.460000,mm
416,0,3,0.312500,<tisk> i don't know
416,0,3,0.296316,really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't i don't know
416,0,3,0.227838,um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i don't know if i really enjoyed that but
416,0,3,0.264000,i felt content after it
416,0,3,1.000000,mm
416,0,3,0.310714,<tisk> not much it's i mean it's kinda sad i don't know uh <laughter>
416,0,3,0.190000,i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know
416,0,3,0.704000,i'm very detail oriented organized
416,0,3,0.318000,i like to finish tasks
416,0,3,0.325455,um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um
416,0,3,0.242581,i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that
416,0,3,0.466667,but yeah that's
416,0,3,0.300000,that's about it
416,0,3,0.600000,<laughter> cool

413,1,10,0.250000,i'm doing okay
413,1,10,0.377500,i'm from greenwich connecticut
413,1,10,0.390000,yes
413,1,10,0.275385,um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago
413,1,10,0.328235,um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less
413,1,10,0.362143,um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general
413,1,10,0.500000,um
413,1,10,0.300000,i think that
413,1,10,0.330667,other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there
413,1,10,0.455000,are just more my
413,1,10,0.285714,type and what i'm used to and
413,1,10,0.436667,it's less superficial
413,1,10,0.305714,<tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california
413,1,10,0.448889,um initially it was easy because i felt like
413,1,10,0.250833,it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just
413,1,10,0.298824,are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in
413,1,10,0.396000,how different it is and
413,1,10,0.361818,what life is out here it became more difficult than originally
413,1,10,0.328000,uh fine arts and photography
413,1,10,0.311765,um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and
413,1,10,0.348750,got awards and things like that and publishments
413,1,10,0.396667,so i decided to pursue art
413,1,10,0.277857,um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and
413,1,10,6.790000,scrubbed_entry
413,1,10,0.415000,yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um
413,1,10,0.362143,i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography
413,1,10,0.354167,i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting
413,1,10,0.970000,um
413,1,10,0.330000,that's a interesting question
413,1,10,0.295714,i guess just my childhood in general
413,1,10,0.230000,growing up
413,1,10,0.583333,um well my family's very close
413,1,10,0.510000,um
413,1,10,0.312143,my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live
413,1,10,0.340333,within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that
413,1,10,0.268889,yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is
413,1,10,0.379231,more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries
413,1,10,0.355000,um i consider myself more shy
413,1,10,0.710000,um
413,1,10,0.770000,i
413,1,10,0.336364,watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted
413,1,10,0.340833,um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and
413,1,10,0.204615,just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to
413,1,10,0.330000,um
413,1,10,0.292857,i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having
413,1,10,0.266190,if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger
413,1,10,0.460000,um
413,1,10,0.322000,well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like
413,1,10,0.595000,insignificant things
413,1,10,0.252500,but other than that
413,1,10,0.359167,um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago
413,1,10,0.610000,um
413,1,10,0.254286,there's been like some tension going on
413,1,10,0.344545,since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter
413,1,10,0.364000,things about his girlfriend and
413,1,10,0.256667,he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to
413,1,10,0.275556,have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways
413,1,10,0.430000,so for like the thirtieth time he
413,1,10,0.171250,we were on the phone and he was
413,1,10,0.252353,<sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and
413,1,10,0.249091,he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i
413,1,10,0.216957,i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me
413,1,10,0.420000,um
413,1,10,0.248333,i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish
413,1,10,0.268846,that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue
413,1,10,0.268750,but the thing is is that he says
413,1,10,0.358000,certain things that are untrue
413,1,10,0.244000,or things he knows that like will tick me off
413,1,10,0.364000,that are really nasty and
413,1,10,0.275556,that he shouldn't be saying to me so he
413,1,10,0.187500,so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really
413,1,10,0.282000,mm like not say anything
413,1,10,0.960000,um
413,1,10,0.366667,well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't
413,1,10,0.307647,i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to
413,1,10,0.242000,after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically
413,1,10,0.337857,changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own
413,1,10,0.265714,so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now
413,1,10,0.245556,that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made
413,1,10,0.620000,um
413,1,10,0.266667,well i wish i could erase
413,1,10,0.602500,the event or seeing
413,1,10,0.517500,my grandmother's funeral which
413,1,10,0.414000,obviously it wouldn't change anything
413,1,10,0.650000,but
413,1,10,0.280000,it wasn't
413,1,10,0.241250,seeing her there was not something i'd wanna
413,1,10,0.312000,like have in my memory
413,1,10,0.370909,um she was she was a very positive influence and always
413,1,10,0.550000,was not judgmental
413,1,10,0.480000,um
413,1,10,0.293684,and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people
413,1,10,0.336923,so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people
413,1,10,0.223125,they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you
413,1,10,0.305000,are older
413,1,10,0.526667,um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep
413,1,10,0.271333,no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m
413,1,10,0.378333,i will be up like clockwork
413,1,10,0.265789,by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to
413,1,10,0.300000,figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer
413,1,10,0.333333,no i just
413,1,10,0.291515,in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's
413,1,10,0.201429,i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning
413,1,10,0.215000,<tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring
413,1,10,0.230000,but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday
413,1,10,0.600000,um
413,1,10,0.186667,i don't know i kind of just feel very
413,1,10,0.410000,mm
413,1,10,0.236667,like so so
413,1,10,0.650000,just
413,1,10,0.300000,no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of
413,1,10,0.690000,one note land
413,1,10,0.338000,i mean nothing like lately
413,1,10,0.400000,um
413,1,10,0.382500,like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and
413,1,10,0.636667,just reserved and
413,1,10,0.633333,not very outgoing
413,1,10,0.430000,no
413,1,10,0.377143,no i have been diagnosed with anxiety
413,1,10,0.264737,um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital
413,1,10,0.220000,um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but
413,1,10,0.273636,they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety
413,1,10,0.298571,i think in the right setting and
413,1,10,0.285385,with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist
413,1,10,0.710000,is helpful
413,1,10,0.255000,and good at what they're doing then yeah
413,1,10,0.239091,no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid
413,1,10,0.218000,um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like
413,1,10,0.246667,deal with whatever issues they were having with me
413,1,10,0.213333,but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day
413,1,10,0.305000,it wasn't
413,1,10,0.199474,i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it
413,1,10,0.347727,<sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday
413,1,10,0.224286,when i'm there i can always just
413,1,10,0.210714,we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to
413,1,10,0.285625,worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out
413,1,10,0.257500,just enjoy the day
413,1,10,0.335000,in general
413,1,10,0.510000,um
413,1,10,0.215455,i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't
413,1,10,0.247500,being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and
413,1,10,0.304118,the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here
413,1,10,0.316538,so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or
413,1,10,0.268889,you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even
413,1,10,0.374000,that it was more like a transfer school like you
413,1,10,0.200000,you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went
413,1,10,0.275000,so it kind of create created more problems for me
413,1,10,0.550000,<sigh>
413,1,10,0.290000,well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago
413,1,10,0.334286,i would give myself the advice to
413,1,10,0.406000,probably stay closer to home
413,1,10,0.193333,and to have
413,1,10,0.402857,really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california
413,1,10,0.690000,um
413,1,10,0.275000,my best friend would describe me
413,1,10,0.526667,as a great charismatic funny outgoing
413,1,10,0.422500,socially enjoyable person which is different than how
413,1,10,0.277778,people who aren't my good friends would describe me
413,1,10,0.230000,which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i
413,1,10,0.282414,am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just
413,1,10,0.452000,i am very shy and
413,1,10,0.460000,don't really
413,1,10,0.435000,speak much
413,1,10,0.382609,um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that
413,1,10,0.330000,yeah
413,1,10,0.620000,um
413,1,10,0.420000,i'm very caring
413,1,10,0.560000,i
413,1,10,0.274286,i'm a very good judge of character
413,1,10,0.222778,which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself
413,1,10,0.510000,um
413,1,10,0.167500,i'm very affectionate <aff>
413,1,10,0.195000,i mean
413,1,10,0.315000,i'm not very affectionate i'm more
413,1,10,0.204286,i mean i guess i guess so
413,1,10,0.470000,thanks
367,1,19,0.980000,<sync>
367,1,19,0.690000,yes
367,1,19,0.570000,i'm okay um
367,1,19,0.293333,i'm a little
367,1,19,0.450000,pensive i guess a little
367,1,19,0.530000,uh down but
367,1,19,0.302500,more or less okay
367,1,19,0.528333,i was born in annapolis maryland
367,1,19,0.340000,on the east coast
367,1,19,0.352500,originally i moved because i went to film school um
367,1,19,0.401364,and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again
367,1,19,0.331111,it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um
367,1,19,0.445000,but living
367,1,19,0.430000,l_a is very has a very different kind of
367,1,19,0.590000,um
367,1,19,0.342727,attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i
367,1,19,0.282727,but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here
367,1,19,0.564000,uh not at all um
367,1,19,0.345000,when i left things got things were sort of i
367,1,19,0.323158,i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um
367,1,19,0.313333,to be with
367,1,19,0.257857,uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of
367,1,19,0.250714,i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of
367,1,19,0.414545,not really speaking to my family or old friends that often
367,1,19,0.762500,it's not easy it's
367,1,19,0.410000,it's kind of um
367,1,19,0.228333,i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job
367,1,19,0.691429,um i miss um some friends um
367,1,19,0.256200,i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot
367,1,19,0.298333,um i feel like i failed
367,1,19,0.299737,and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard
367,1,19,0.489545,depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable
367,1,19,0.332083,um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy
367,1,19,0.260000,so that doesn't really answer your question but
367,1,19,0.526667,um [clears throat]
367,1,19,0.323333,i have certain
367,1,19,0.226250,i do i do a lot of writing
367,1,19,0.660000,um i have certain
367,1,19,0.355833,music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can
367,1,19,0.266111,when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of
367,1,19,0.910000,happening really um
367,1,19,0.287333,it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess
367,1,19,0.780000,um
367,1,19,0.305476,a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel
367,1,19,0.294000,and when i was really
367,1,19,0.331000,when i was really getting into writing it and um
367,1,19,0.299815,it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed
367,1,19,0.830000,um
367,1,19,0.423750,it was about a
367,1,19,0.454000,guy who is searching for
367,1,19,0.860000,something it's
367,1,19,0.350833,it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he
367,1,19,0.370000,that he
367,1,19,0.506667,met and just
367,1,19,0.265000,was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because
367,1,19,0.287143,sort of uh it's sort of romantic
367,1,19,0.494000,adventure comedy kind of thing
367,1,19,0.258500,well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting
367,1,19,0.650625,um so i wrote some screenplays and uh
367,1,19,0.316351,you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer
367,1,19,0.685000,just creative writing so
367,1,19,0.326471,i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to
367,1,19,0.360000,to really hit me
367,1,19,0.388000,it's not easy the [exhale]
367,1,19,0.345263,the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um
367,1,19,0.279630,i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i
367,1,19,0.321667,hate it because it's so difficult
367,1,19,0.540000,um
367,1,19,0.296250,but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
367,1,19,0.297000,good i don't i don't really have a temper i
367,1,19,0.386905,it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people
367,1,19,0.441000,um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can
367,1,19,0.255800,lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much
367,1,19,0.335000,try to it when i'm upset
367,1,19,0.375500,i i get upset with myself not with other people
367,1,19,0.610000,um
367,1,19,0.336429,last night i guess well <weh> um
367,1,19,0.296667,i got in an argument about whether or not
367,1,19,0.719167,cleaning vegetables was necessary because of
367,1,19,0.257727,i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay
367,1,19,0.278000,so it turned into this
367,1,19,0.279211,big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i
367,1,19,0.301111,i ended up being wrong on that one but
367,1,19,0.255000,it is
367,1,19,0.287333,yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument
367,1,19,0.730000,um
367,1,19,0.690000,uh
367,1,19,0.465000,a lot so much um
367,1,19,0.740000,uh
367,1,19,0.570000,i
367,1,19,0.330000,i
367,1,19,0.347000,i was in uh a relationship that i really really
367,1,19,0.600000,um
367,1,19,0.256667,that i really wanted to work
367,1,19,0.690000,and
367,1,19,0.550000,uh
367,1,19,0.284444,i ended up and it was partly due to
367,1,19,0.270313,i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going
367,1,19,0.323750,at like everything sort of spiraled out of
367,1,19,0.319118,control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't
367,1,19,0.346667,i wasn't mean but i was
367,1,19,0.298889,but i was getting more and more messed up
367,1,19,0.375095,and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not
367,1,19,0.260000,and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again
367,1,19,0.670000,so
367,1,19,0.330000,that was pretty that was pretty tough
367,1,19,0.406429,well some of it was was that
367,1,19,0.405882,i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's
367,1,19,0.355000,completely kind of i mean i still get
367,1,19,0.243529,i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not
367,1,19,0.343000,i don't completely lose it for days at a time
367,1,19,0.540000,um
367,1,19,0.470000,so
367,1,19,0.263679,i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then
367,1,19,0.320714,i would've i would i would be
367,1,19,0.323333,i would be
367,1,19,0.271667,it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have
367,1,19,0.260833,i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different
367,1,19,0.350000,things being how they were
367,1,19,0.280000,i mean it's
367,1,19,0.726667,it's possible uh
367,1,19,0.433333,i mean obviously
367,1,19,0.348000,yeah because i mean that's what i do i i
367,1,19,0.258261,take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until
367,1,19,0.357778,until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff
367,1,19,0.555000,um
367,1,19,0.358333,and it's like any little detail that comes up
367,1,19,0.244444,i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still
367,1,19,0.306667,i still get
367,1,19,0.290789,i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school
367,1,19,0.279355,which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there
367,1,19,0.377500,well it's it's not
367,1,19,0.205625,easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by
367,1,19,0.389706,by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way
367,1,19,0.319815,um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better
367,1,19,0.375500,um well like i said i do a lot of
367,1,19,0.214211,you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost
367,1,19,0.458636,be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely
367,1,19,0.272800,um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be
367,1,19,0.284524,you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just
367,1,19,0.491250,keep my mind occupied during all of that
367,1,19,0.590000,um
367,1,19,0.256000,i just need i mean
367,1,19,0.260435,i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet
367,1,19,0.405000,they're triggered by everything
367,1,19,0.333000,pretty much anything that i that i see if i
367,1,19,0.330000,if i
367,1,19,0.308269,if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about
367,1,19,0.640000,just
367,1,19,0.420556,anything you know i can reach back and connect
367,1,19,0.490000,to
367,1,19,0.333333,to this it's really it's really
367,1,19,0.258214,i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break
367,1,19,0.480000,from it
367,1,19,0.700000,yeah
367,1,19,0.650000,um
367,1,19,0.234000,i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i
367,1,19,0.238947,awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally
367,1,19,0.330000,you know don't
367,1,19,0.325500,i don't know i never really needed much sleep so
367,1,19,0.285263,it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep
367,1,19,0.242317,like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work
367,1,19,0.279483,um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly
367,1,19,0.244545,you know i get up i toss and turn all night
367,1,19,0.275000,you know and now
367,1,19,0.475000,it's just
367,1,19,0.610000,it's
367,1,19,0.283750,yeah i don't sleep too great right now
367,1,19,1.000000,um
367,1,19,0.383333,pretty i mean
367,1,19,0.224545,i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i
367,1,19,0.279000,i usually just kind of power through it and just
367,1,19,0.275000,i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel
367,1,19,0.710000,bad
367,1,19,0.800000,um
367,1,19,0.405000,i think
367,1,19,0.396667,about three three four years ago
367,1,19,0.690000,um
367,1,19,0.477500,it was when i
367,1,19,0.295556,i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for
367,1,19,0.520000,for
367,1,19,0.339783,years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got
367,1,19,0.680000,this
367,1,19,0.263833,situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like
367,1,19,0.293846,even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so
367,1,19,0.278571,so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately
367,1,19,0.553125,it happened after everything uh went bad so
367,1,19,0.196667,i don't know
367,1,19,0.276875,in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel
367,1,19,0.282500,it really makes me
367,1,19,0.301250,angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm
367,1,19,0.389500,that i had to that i i lost everything because
367,1,19,0.405000,because of
367,1,19,0.328636,chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control
367,1,19,0.256071,and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't
367,1,19,0.322778,it was it didn't help it didn't work until
367,1,19,0.740000,until
367,1,19,0.325870,you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but
367,1,19,0.265556,it was a little it's a little late now
367,1,19,0.570000,um
367,1,19,0.289062,there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was
367,1,19,0.306667,it was either
367,1,19,0.302895,i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different
367,1,19,0.267045,but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after
367,1,19,0.322000,after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off
367,1,19,0.412000,but it was at least
367,1,19,0.383333,that and not
367,1,19,0.535000,firing me
367,1,19,0.313333,but but but yeah but so i got help but it was
367,1,19,0.394000,but it wasn't soon enough
367,1,19,0.650000,uh not
367,1,19,0.406667,not as much as i should
367,1,19,0.600000,um
367,1,19,0.243333,i go to a couple of
367,1,19,1.010000,meetings
367,1,19,0.261364,i go to i go to a_a so that i can
367,1,19,0.259750,um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that
367,1,19,0.473333,um unfortunately you know being unemployed
367,1,19,0.333750,my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so
367,1,19,0.392308,you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing
367,1,19,0.270769,somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really
367,1,19,0.610000,very
367,1,19,0.317917,i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so
367,1,19,0.352857,it's basically to keep my medication coming
367,1,19,0.384000,and then there's you <laughter>
367,1,19,0.660000,right
367,1,19,0.320000,well like i said i mean
367,1,19,0.306567,just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now
367,1,19,0.468571,um just saying stuff outloud is just
367,1,19,0.565833,like getting getting this stuff out
367,1,19,0.287407,trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense
367,1,19,0.256667,that you can actually deal with
367,1,19,0.394000,is a big step like
367,1,19,0.466667,regardless of who
367,1,19,0.312600,you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that
367,1,19,0.303333,stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can
367,1,19,0.337667,talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing
367,1,19,0.580000,yeah
367,1,19,0.690000,um
367,1,19,0.260833,you know better than i than i have been um i mean
367,1,19,0.290000,it it sort of
367,1,19,0.182222,it goes <g> it has its ups and downs
367,1,19,0.468571,um you know i'm applying for jobs
367,1,19,0.420000,five six jobs
367,1,19,0.295937,or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview
367,1,19,0.346000,never even getting close to
367,1,19,0.458333,to to being self sufficient again
367,1,19,0.680000,um
367,1,19,0.345000,it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control
367,1,19,0.246154,so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is
367,1,19,0.281000,it just has its it's just its own own challenge
367,1,19,0.560000,yeah
367,1,19,0.610000,um
367,1,19,0.268333,it was probably you know a couple years ago
367,1,19,0.810000,um
367,1,19,0.433333,i i was
367,1,19,0.237778,i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind
367,1,19,0.540000,uh
367,1,19,0.460000,is
367,1,19,0.299167,everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close
367,1,19,0.300000,we were having fun together
367,1,19,0.460000,and we went out and got a christmas tree
367,1,19,0.670000,and
367,1,19,0.276875,we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just
367,1,19,0.431429,feeling like a part of somebody's life
367,1,19,0.566250,and feeling like a part of the bigger
367,1,19,0.426667,the bigger life
367,1,19,0.327273,that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel
367,1,19,0.267500,you know for that instant i felt like
367,1,19,0.421842,a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and
367,1,19,0.449375,you know everything was going really well and
367,1,19,0.282826,i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person
367,1,19,0.375000,a normal happy person
367,1,19,0.620000,and
367,1,19,0.230909,part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that
367,1,19,0.253333,i don't know if i'll ever feel that again
367,1,19,0.570000,so
367,1,19,0.570000,um
367,1,19,0.745000,probably the
367,1,19,0.455000,probably this
367,1,19,0.554286,educational <educary> educational series i did uh
367,1,19,0.715000,an educational
367,1,19,0.345000,uh video series i did for the national science foundation
367,1,19,0.520000,um
367,1,19,0.390000,it was
367,1,19,0.288824,it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and
367,1,19,0.335600,you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um
367,1,19,0.277250,and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to
367,1,19,0.415000,the world
367,1,19,0.286667,oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um
367,1,19,0.270000,it was it was a
367,1,19,0.214286,we were trying to come up with
367,1,19,0.547500,with new ideas uh
367,1,19,0.296538,for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know
367,1,19,0.258947,to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big
367,1,19,0.230000,you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um
367,1,19,0.258889,and there was a lot to it and so
367,1,19,0.410000,it was probably the biggest
367,1,19,0.404063,project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it
367,1,19,0.478750,right that doesn't yeah
367,1,19,0.740000,um
367,1,19,0.365000,i guess

419,0,3,0.335455,i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see
419,0,3,0.385882,the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great um structures
419,0,3,0.341667,uh i consider myself more shy
419,0,3,0.485556,um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable
419,0,3,0.515000,um i'm not one to just
419,0,3,0.387143,go up to people and start conversations
419,0,3,0.274737,um if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just
419,0,3,0.206250,kind of out of place at a party
419,0,3,0.438000,um i actually studied history
419,0,3,0.340000,<laughter>
419,0,3,0.370000,um i've always been interested in history
419,0,3,0.463750,and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course u_s history
419,0,3,0.338333,so i'm very into uh history
419,0,3,0.395556,um i'm actually working in uh the education field
419,0,3,0.321707,my dream job would actually be um traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel <laughter> that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do
419,0,3,0.520000,doing
419,0,3,0.760000,um
419,0,3,0.228000,so i would love to do that as a job
419,0,3,0.530000,<laughter>
419,0,3,0.850000,<laughter>
419,0,3,0.447500,um i love reading
419,0,3,0.317727,and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath
419,0,3,0.383077,and um i also like going to the gym that helps me uh
419,0,3,0.387500,deal with stress and
419,0,3,0.370000,it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising
419,0,3,0.670000,um
419,0,3,0.266364,i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily
419,0,3,0.380000,and sometimes as an adult i still get angry
419,0,3,0.326250,easily but i've gotten a lot better at
419,0,3,0.341000,trying to think about things first before saying them and
419,0,3,0.583333,not having outbursts
419,0,3,0.186667,things like that
419,0,3,0.432000,um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend
419,0,3,0.375000,and she actually she has kids i don't
419,0,3,0.446667,and for some reason she thought
419,0,3,0.347895,or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and
419,0,3,0.278125,she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things
419,0,3,0.293000,um i don't think i've ever made her feel that
419,0,3,0.266667,i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it
419,0,3,1.210000,um
419,0,3,0.431818,well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because
419,0,3,0.324545,when she was talking to me she was very upset and
419,0,3,0.286154,i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her
419,0,3,0.305714,but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling
419,0,3,0.212778,match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and
419,0,3,0.308235,maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument
419,0,3,0.329444,um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation
419,0,3,0.366667,i felt that maybe i could've just let her
419,0,3,0.298462,let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly
419,0,3,0.315714,um instead of yelling at her too
419,0,3,0.723333,oh wow um
419,0,3,0.352857,that's a tough one i think um
419,0,3,0.268696,gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years
419,0,3,0.660000,um
419,0,3,0.257692,although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was
419,0,3,0.264118,kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and
419,0,3,0.450000,i kinda felt by ending the relationship um
419,0,3,0.356000,i would've wasted those last seven years of my life
419,0,3,0.295714,it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did
419,0,3,0.265000,because then i went on to meet um
419,0,3,0.295000,my husband
419,0,3,0.570000,<laughter>
419,0,3,0.200000,thank you
419,0,3,0.750000,um well about i would say
419,0,3,0.610000,maybe
419,0,3,0.552000,fifteen years ago i was
419,0,3,0.264444,hanging out with a couple of friends at a
419,0,3,0.510000,club
419,0,3,0.390000,and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place
419,0,3,0.304348,and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it
419,0,3,0.288182,but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them
419,0,3,1.010000,and
419,0,3,0.376000,back at their house um
419,0,3,0.262500,one of the guys
419,0,3,0.442857,actually pulled me into a room and
419,0,3,0.820000,tried
419,0,3,0.311667,i i got scared i yelled
419,0,3,0.358750,he tried to choke me and i thought
419,0,3,0.217857,i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me
419,0,3,0.285000,but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left
419,0,3,0.630000,so
419,0,3,0.288636,it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind
419,0,3,0.210000,it was
419,0,3,0.304444,um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother
419,0,3,0.287857,um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older
419,0,3,0.291667,and we get along pretty well
419,0,3,0.306538,um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever
419,0,3,0.286000,and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents
419,0,3,0.490000,um my dad
419,0,3,0.246923,still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me
419,0,3,0.277000,but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship
419,0,3,0.130000,yeah
419,0,3,0.475000,um <sigh> i usually wake up
419,0,3,0.246667,a few times throughout the night
419,0,3,1.060000,um
419,0,3,0.690000,so
419,0,3,0.176250,i think it's rare for me to sleep
419,0,3,0.315000,uh the whole night through ever
419,0,3,0.317143,um and i do feel a little
419,0,3,0.232941,like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely
419,0,3,0.730000,um
419,0,3,0.214545,so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep
419,0,3,0.440000,um i don't know it
419,0,3,0.172857,i have a hard time falling asleep
419,0,3,0.400000,and then sometimes i have bad dreams or
419,0,3,0.289000,i need to get up to use the restroom um
419,0,3,0.316667,but yeah it
419,0,3,0.275556,i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once
419,0,3,0.810000,um
419,0,3,0.900000,emotionally good
419,0,3,0.359231,um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice
419,0,3,0.820000,um
419,0,3,0.268125,physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kinda
419,0,3,0.393333,makes me feel
419,0,3,0.370000,bad um 'cause i like working out
419,0,3,0.431429,um but health wise i'm good <laughter>
419,0,3,0.410000,no
419,0,3,0.370000,no
419,0,3,1.180000,um
419,0,3,0.610000,it was
419,0,3,0.300000,last <la> this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband
419,0,3,0.289091,we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but
419,0,3,0.359000,we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and
419,0,3,0.250909,went to the beach and just had a really good time
419,0,3,0.568182,um she would probably describe me as a good caring person
419,0,3,0.830000,um
419,0,3,0.880000,patient
419,0,3,0.655000,very shy
419,0,3,1.010000,um
419,0,3,0.270000,she'd probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors 'cause i'm always doing things for other people
419,0,3,0.230000,um so yeah that's how i think she would describe me
419,0,3,0.446667,i wish i was more outgoing
419,0,3,0.830000,um
419,0,3,0.836667,i wish that
419,0,3,1.300000,i
419,0,3,0.175000,what else
419,0,3,0.470000,definitely more outgoing
419,0,3,0.920000,um
419,0,3,0.288421,so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy
419,0,3,0.351000,um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do <laughter> sometimes i'm very short of patience
419,0,3,0.538333,and um i wish i could
419,0,3,0.215000,find a better job so i could do more traveling
419,0,3,1.070000,um
419,0,3,0.312500,yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree
419,0,3,0.332857,and i really wish that i could've
419,0,3,0.236667,you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did
419,0,3,0.840000,um
419,0,3,0.286429,and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend
419,0,3,0.476364,um i would've told myself to stay focused on school that
419,0,3,0.414286,going out and hanging out and just
419,0,3,0.170000,you know
419,0,3,0.312727,and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first
419,0,3,0.402941,um i'm proud that after so many years of not being in school i was able to
419,0,3,0.304286,go to u_c_l_a and get my degree
419,0,3,0.990000,um
419,0,3,0.408571,yeah that would be my proudest achievement
419,0,3,0.300000,<laughter>
419,0,3,0.310000,okay
419,0,3,0.245000,thank you
419,0,3,0.420000,bye
353,1,11,0.210000,yes 
353,1,11,0.193333,i'm okay 
353,1,11,0.406667,um pennsylvania 
353,1,11,0.400000,mhm
353,1,11,0.226176,um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life
353,1,11,0.340769,um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once
353,1,11,0.240000,a year
353,1,11,0.640000,um
353,1,11,0.527500,definitely safer and um definitely a more um
353,1,11,0.190769,well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here
353,1,11,0.410000,um 
353,1,11,0.215526,not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment 
353,1,11,0.440000,no
353,1,11,0.522500,um advertising communications 
353,1,11,0.305333,um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment
353,1,11,0.357500,um i wanna be an osteopathic physician 
353,1,11,0.446667,um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who
353,1,11,0.289302,helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live 
353,1,11,0.316471,a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine 
353,1,11,0.216000,um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast  
353,1,11,0.363333,um sometimes 
353,1,11,0.338750,um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and
353,1,11,0.352059,eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups
353,1,11,0.560000,um
353,1,11,0.256364,eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings 
353,1,11,0.507500,um i usually 
353,1,11,0.213077,try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated 
353,1,11,0.272174,um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset  
353,1,11,0.462500,um <sigh> let's see
353,1,11,0.850000,uh mm
353,1,11,0.218750,i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case 
353,1,11,0.249167,yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers  
353,1,11,0.383333,i have no idea <laughter> 
353,1,11,0.755714,um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um
353,1,11,0.261429,i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people
353,1,11,0.294783,um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em 
353,1,11,0.440000,no
353,1,11,0.210000,yes 
353,1,11,0.322308,um just a few months ago about in the last six months 
353,1,11,0.636667,um i was
353,1,11,0.815000,experiencing 
353,1,11,0.311053,mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't 
353,1,11,0.630000,um
353,1,11,0.235000,i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself 
353,1,11,0.302162,um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um 
353,1,11,0.247857,that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working  
353,1,11,0.340000,um 
353,1,11,0.346429,i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so
353,1,11,0.233939,um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings
353,1,11,0.288421,and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out
353,1,11,0.980000,um
353,1,11,0.383077,well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um 
353,1,11,0.472667,and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and
353,1,11,0.321250,i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that  
353,1,11,0.296923,i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home   
353,1,11,0.390000,um 
353,1,11,0.418462,it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um
353,1,11,0.286818,i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling 
353,1,11,0.143333,i do 
353,1,11,0.630000,um <sigh>
353,1,11,0.386154,well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um
353,1,11,0.545000,and i am more
353,1,11,0.353000,cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts
353,1,11,0.720000,um
353,1,11,0.278333,and about my decisions as well
353,1,11,0.296667,i'm not so
353,1,11,0.265000,i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life  
353,1,11,0.240976,um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours
353,1,11,0.264545,but now i am um sleeping through the night again 
353,1,11,0.478333,um i feel <f> groggy <sigh>
353,1,11,0.312000,k i feel foggy and out of it um 
353,1,11,0.342857,and just low kind of depressed 
353,1,11,0.330000,mm
353,1,11,0.563333,<sigh> it's um
353,1,11,0.250000,i think it's been awhile 
353,1,11,0.550000,um
353,1,11,0.392222,working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um
353,1,11,0.350000,spending time with my family

353,1,11,0.284483,giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then 
353,1,11,0.260690,my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um 
353,1,11,0.301818,looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um
353,1,11,0.470000,he's been very
353,1,11,0.372333,uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and
353,1,11,0.225000,and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or
353,1,11,0.326000,um running errands without having a lot of anxiety 
353,1,11,0.486667,um i'm most proud of 
353,1,11,0.350769,the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um 
353,1,11,0.291875,maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it
353,1,11,0.324167,going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut 
353,1,11,0.295000,um

355,1,10,0.357143,uh well the weather and uh 
355,1,10,0.305000,the fact that uh people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast 
355,1,10,0.580000,uh
355,1,10,0.402857,just the uh the traffic and the
355,1,10,0.280000,the smoggy weather

355,1,10,0.560000,option

355,1,10,0.317143,or or a friend but you know
355,1,10,0.266655,especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four 
355,1,10,0.330000,uh i don't do much
355,1,10,0.282857,much different than i would otherwise 
355,1,10,0.335000,uh and i've had many temper outbursts
355,1,10,0.280000,uh 
355,1,10,0.257143,i kinda argue with my aunt 
355,1,10,0.317375,and it was because she was basically 
355,1,10,0.350769,making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative
355,1,10,0.268750,and uh it annoyed me greatly  
355,1,10,0.279091,uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents 
355,1,10,0.264286,i'm kind of the black sheep

355,1,10,0.257576,of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably
355,1,10,0.270000,fifteen years ago 
355,1,10,0.470000,well
355,1,10,0.322500,i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh

355,1,10,0.322308,fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing 
355,1,10,0.374545,you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county
355,1,10,0.284000,and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a 
355,1,10,0.281429,not not hard it was just uh
355,1,10,0.210000,just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually
355,1,10,0.312941,missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera   
355,1,10,0.170000,i don't have a best friend

355,1,10,0.478000,two state colleges and two
355,1,10,0.354000,junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my 
355,1,10,0.230909,you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall 
355,1,10,0.271667,yeah i regret you know

355,1,10,0.482500,i would've uh

355,1,10,0.292500,you know i could always get another one and not you know
355,1,10,0.339048,basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now

351,1,14,0.575000,um yes
351,1,14,0.345714,uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things

351,1,14,0.580000,um
351,1,14,0.369091,i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually
351,1,14,0.323182,um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
351,1,14,0.680000,um
351,1,14,0.241429,um probably spending time with my family
351,1,14,0.143333,in new york

351,1,14,0.555000,i guess loyal um
351,1,14,0.622500,sensitive um <laughter> 
351,1,14,0.316923,i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter>
351,1,14,0.310000,no
351,1,14,0.290000,no <clears throat> 
351,1,14,0.540000,yes
351,1,14,0.443846,gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago
351,1,14,0.730000,um
351,1,14,0.373500,i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff
351,1,14,0.316364,um not currently i i did about like six months ago
351,1,14,0.296800,um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and
351,1,14,0.244583,xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
351,1,14,0.343333,it's okay <laughter>
351,1,14,0.382857,um yes i do actually um 
351,1,14,0.358438,when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do
351,1,14,0.560000,um
351,1,14,0.320667,i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um
351,1,14,0.292727,when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um   
351,1,14,0.271923,also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself
351,1,14,0.299286,so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
351,1,14,0.690000,um
351,1,14,0.334000,feeling hopeless all the time
351,1,14,0.343182,not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues 
351,1,14,0.250000,um
351,1,14,0.340000,having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life 
351,1,14,0.590000,um
351,1,14,0.358718,sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me 
351,1,14,0.422727,um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal
351,1,14,0.296667,to record things
351,1,14,0.090000,<clears throat> 
351,1,14,0.370345,um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter> 
351,1,14,0.393333,um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it
351,1,14,0.343333,um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult
351,1,14,0.257105,um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat>
351,1,14,0.322000,um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um
351,1,14,0.245435,that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>
351,1,14,0.325455,um probably christmas time when i was with my family 
351,1,14,0.703333,um just really happy and um
351,1,14,0.197778,feeling like everything was alright in my life 
351,1,14,0.297500,having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself
351,1,14,0.680000,um
351,1,14,0.560000,probably you know um
351,1,14,0.235000,let's see that's a hard question
351,1,14,0.480000,i think probably
351,1,14,0.364167,i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um 
351,1,14,0.365909,uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um
351,1,14,0.268462,i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter> 
351,1,14,0.760000,um
351,1,14,0.475000,um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um
351,1,14,0.317200,one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter> 
351,1,14,0.730000,um
351,1,14,0.588333,don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um
351,1,14,0.210000,i think that's it <laughter>
351,1,14,0.540000,um
351,1,14,0.143333,i don't know
351,1,14,0.257500,that's a good question
351,1,14,0.375625,probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um 
351,1,14,0.412308,so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher
351,1,14,0.188333,um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out
351,1,14,0.273750,for about six years so seven years 
351,1,14,0.287500,yeah it was awesome
351,1,14,0.730000,um
351,1,14,0.355000,i was really kind of like um 
351,1,14,0.380833,reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat>
351,1,14,0.247273,so uh and then i went a worked in a um
351,1,14,0.419500,mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so

418,1,10,0.570000,um
418,1,10,0.352143,put my son under the in in foster care for for for a minute
418,1,10,0.210000,that was the hardest decision that i had to make
418,1,10,10.090000,scrubbed_entry
418,1,10,0.516667,um a schizophrenic
418,1,10,0.515000,and he had had
418,1,10,0.330000,um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old
418,1,10,0.840000,um but
418,1,10,0.364000,and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up
418,1,10,0.377500,um so right now he he's in a supportive living environment he's twenty seven years old
418,1,10,0.314118,um but he he he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now
418,1,10,0.260000,i had problems in the past 'cause he didn't wanna take the medication you'd give him the medication and he'd hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever
418,1,10,0.281250,so but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing he's doing pretty good
418,1,10,1.730000,scrubbed_entry
418,1,10,0.282500,um that son he's twenty <twen> he's twenty seven as i said 'cause he's a twin
418,1,10,0.950000,um
418,1,10,0.400000,um was living in texas with his wife
418,1,10,0.375000,and um he got a promotion to um
418,1,10,3.170000,scrubbed_entry
418,1,10,0.407273,now he's in california too both are in california okay so
418,1,10,0.720000,um
418,1,10,0.292857,i feel very good about that yeah
418,1,10,0.590000,uh
418,1,10,0.870000,hm
418,1,10,0.394000,well of grown children yes
418,1,10,0.530000,<laughter> of grown children yes

418,1,10,0.218000,no i take that back
418,1,10,0.363214,not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger there were difficult times okay difficult periods and um
418,1,10,0.227778,just it was a lot of good times too but yeah it was there were some difficult times
418,1,10,1.080000,mm
418,1,10,0.341379,well the mm the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to and that was when um one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and um
418,1,10,0.585000,and um
418,1,10,0.366667,they were in
418,1,10,0.790000,temporarily and
418,1,10,0.366522,in in well one was in foster care and one was actually um in a institution 'cause of the um the um schizophrenia
418,1,10,0.710000,um
418,1,10,0.830000,so
418,1,10,0.346250,think i lost track of the question <laughter>
418,1,10,0.278571,the hardest thing about being a parent
418,1,10,0.223684,at this point at this <the> at this point in my life there is is nothing hard about it
418,1,10,0.970000,um
418,1,10,0.270000,the best thing about being a parent
418,1,10,0.263000,i don't know i guess it's just to see <cough>
418,1,10,0.372632,something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person
418,1,10,0.290000,that's the best thing
418,1,10,0.228000,oh a lot of ways
418,1,10,0.620000,um well actually
418,1,10,0.250000,i didn't have two parents i had a mother
418,1,10,0.247778,and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um
418,1,10,0.326667,but the thing that i do
418,1,10,0.415000,differently than what my mother did
418,1,10,0.600000,um
418,1,10,0.394000,she was a strong disciplinarian
418,1,10,0.540000,um both verbally and physically
418,1,10,0.840000,um
418,1,10,0.970000,and
418,1,10,0.534444,she at she had this tendency which she outgrew
418,1,10,0.375833,she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um
418,1,10,0.843333,um opinionated <laughter> and very religious
418,1,10,0.930000,um
418,1,10,0.393333,and sort of
418,1,10,0.321250,sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they
418,1,10,0.245000,were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing
418,1,10,0.194000,what was the other part
418,1,10,0.286667,of the question
418,1,10,0.273810,i i i don't get a good night's sleep or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it if i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night i'll
418,1,10,0.355455,i will be up for days if i don't take medication
418,1,10,0.723333,man irritable um

315,0,2,0.345000,and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know just
315,0,2,0.366842,education-wise it's just i think it's just tough times for kids and and the way they act uh it's

474,0,4,0.267500,um because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me
474,0,4,0.470000,totally
474,0,4,0.730000,um
474,0,4,0.040000,<makes sound with mouth>
474,0,4,0.550000,i uh
474,0,4,0.363333,i i um
474,0,4,0.620000,no regrets no <laughter> um <laughter>
474,0,4,0.785000,i guess
474,0,4,0.320000,hmm
474,0,4,0.165000,i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but
474,0,4,0.297333,uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off
474,0,4,0.720000,and
474,0,4,0.193158,i think it'd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago
474,0,4,0.160769,um it was just one of those days where i just didn't want
474,0,4,0.195455,or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot
474,0,4,0.600000,and
474,0,4,0.202500,actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off
474,0,4,0.257500,and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh
474,0,4,0.206000,and then flip me off
474,0,4,0.229200,so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off
474,0,4,0.317500,and and she said oh you know i'm
474,0,4,0.212571,i've had a rough day i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter and you know
474,0,4,0.228182,i didn't need to be petty like that but i just
474,0,4,0.193333,i wanted to be i guess
474,0,4,0.443750,ooh <sigh> mm look at you going deep
474,0,4,0.485000,<laughter> um
474,0,4,0.352308,oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh
474,0,4,0.186000,telling her i was gay
474,0,4,0.248000,i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she
474,0,4,0.217600,she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be
474,0,4,0.214444,but it was just hard in the moment to
474,0,4,0.174444,you know tell her something she didn't wanna hear
474,0,4,0.380000,okay
474,0,4,0.810000,um
474,0,4,0.190000,when i was a little kid my um
474,0,4,0.289167,my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road
474,0,4,0.346667,and he uh
474,0,4,5.470000,scrubbed_entry
474,0,4,0.256154,and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just
474,0,4,0.287500,uh like seeing death like that really just
474,0,4,0.242500,threw me off and
474,0,4,0.317500,uh frightened me and
474,0,4,0.223103,uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad
474,0,4,0.355000,and uh
474,0,4,0.225185,it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face
474,0,4,0.280000,yeah
474,0,4,0.310000,my relationship with my family is pretty good um
474,0,4,0.264000,we're probably not as close as most but uh we
474,0,4,0.250000,you know we always
474,0,4,0.297273,we don't talk often but we talk with love and we
474,0,4,0.144444,always love each other when we see each other
474,0,4,0.790000,um
474,0,4,0.263077,my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me
474,0,4,0.350000,to uh you know pursue my dreams and
474,0,4,0.196667,not to let the little things get me down so i'm glad i had her
474,0,4,0.425714,usually it's easy um sometimes it's not
474,0,4,0.460000,um
474,0,4,0.260000,well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week
474,0,4,0.300000,but
474,0,4,0.326667,while i've been off uh while i haven't been working um i tend to like
474,0,4,0.230588,my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like
474,0,4,0.260526,fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven
474,0,4,0.225000,so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty
474,0,4,0.174444,and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half
474,0,4,0.225000,when i should be
474,0,4,0.142105,i should <sh> i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but
474,0,4,0.190000,still wanna stay up i guess
474,0,4,0.282500,uh a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained 'cause uh
474,0,4,0.220588,i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and
474,0,4,0.627500,so <sigh> scatterbrained <laughter>
474,0,4,0.201000,um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because
474,0,4,0.251250,um you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess um
474,0,4,0.360000,but
474,0,4,0.360000,yeah
474,0,4,0.183333,i think that answers the question
474,0,4,0.331053,um i just that maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with uh the not working thing
474,0,4,0.580000,no
474,0,4,0.250000,mm mm
474,0,4,0.226875,um a couple days ago when i got my new job <laughter> when i got hired

474,0,4,0.260000,yeah
474,0,4,0.545000,oh um

474,0,4,0.239000,like he was like pretty nice to me i thought
474,0,4,0.212000,and i didn't realize he'd

350,1,11,0.360000,<cough>
350,1,11,0.347000,um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa
350,1,11,0.301176,in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people 
350,1,11,0.248974,a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way  
350,1,11,0.266923,i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget
350,1,11,0.215000,<laughter>

350,1,11,0.590000,wow
350,1,11,0.481250,anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so
350,1,11,0.249444,yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that   
350,1,11,0.415000,um 
350,1,11,0.686667,occasionally yes <laughter>
350,1,11,0.325000,um <clears throat> 
350,1,11,0.316667,i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know  
350,1,11,0.670000,mm
350,1,11,0.330000,well 
350,1,11,0.369091,i don't know i read um i just started meditation 
350,1,11,0.382500,mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter>
350,1,11,0.175000,yeah 
350,1,11,0.270000,some things that make me really mad
350,1,11,0.285000,um 
350,1,11,0.325000,mistreatment of children 
350,1,11,0.262500,abuse of children 
350,1,11,0.313333,um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can
350,1,11,0.275750,control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all 
350,1,11,0.232609,oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah   
350,1,11,0.232500,the last time i argued with someone 
350,1,11,0.503333,was um 
350,1,11,0.346429,i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um
350,1,11,0.275385,it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter> 
350,1,11,0.180000,yeah 
350,1,11,2.130000,<laughter>
350,1,11,0.256667,this is cool
350,1,11,0.273846,uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day 
350,1,11,0.334815,there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences 
350,1,11,0.217037,well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her 
350,1,11,0.314242,because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children 
350,1,11,0.331463,and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to  
350,1,11,0.266667,you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to 
350,1,11,0.325294,you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible  
350,1,11,0.240000,no i have not 
350,1,11,0.480000,no
350,1,11,0.176667,i have 
350,1,11,0.593333,um well i was diagnosed um
350,1,11,0.314118,within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months 
350,1,11,0.440000,well
350,1,11,0.276667,um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling
350,1,11,0.362500,and not knowing um
350,1,11,0.265385,you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling 
350,1,11,0.250000,there were a lot of symptoms um 
350,1,11,0.780000,um
350,1,11,0.309091,you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight
350,1,11,0.395000,um i couldn't sleep a lot
350,1,11,0.304545,and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um 
350,1,11,0.310000,felt sad sometimes 
350,1,11,0.168750,like i wanted to cry a lot 
350,1,11,0.280000,i've been feeling okay
350,1,11,0.317143,um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so
350,1,11,0.208919,i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get  
350,1,11,0.228333,out and do more things 
350,1,11,0.310000,um 
350,1,11,0.377500,no no it's no no i haven't 
350,1,11,0.305000,not any different from
350,1,11,0.272857,before what i was experiencing before 
350,1,11,0.175000,no 
350,1,11,0.300000,mm
350,1,11,0.461429,well mm i was receiving um 
350,1,11,0.486667,uh i guess psychotherapy and um
350,1,11,0.234000,i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda 
350,1,11,0.216250,got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while 
350,1,11,0.333333,uh sometimes 
350,1,11,0.150000,i do 
350,1,11,0.263333,yes it is
350,1,11,0.340000,it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep
350,1,11,0.287241,i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind
350,1,11,0.202917,that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep
350,1,11,0.340000,mhm
350,1,11,0.286500,um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps
350,1,11,0.285882,other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping 
350,1,11,0.230000,it
350,1,11,0.363333,tired <laughter> 
350,1,11,0.514000,yeah mostly uh tired um
350,1,11,0.330000,kinda confused 
350,1,11,0.241333,i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um  
350,1,11,0.321538,last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays 
350,1,11,0.276552,uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me
350,1,11,0.325000,and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um
350,1,11,0.182500,that's about it 
350,1,11,0.251455,how would my best friend describe me probably as um 
350,1,11,0.880750,quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious 
350,1,11,0.293913,um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and
350,1,11,0.313684,they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or
350,1,11,0.531667,um easy to talk to um
350,1,11,0.206000,that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them 
350,1,11,0.370000,<laughter> 
350,1,11,0.488727,um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff 
350,1,11,0.276667,to just 
350,1,11,0.281000,relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people
350,1,11,0.299130,because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you
350,1,11,0.267750,are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their 
350,1,11,0.281905,their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just
350,1,11,0.200435,believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be 
350,1,11,0.135000,yeah 
350,1,11,0.561250,um really enjoyed working with um well 
350,1,11,0.530000,okay
350,1,11,0.310000,a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball
350,1,11,0.330000,um being the first to attend college in my family
350,1,11,0.314681,and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so 
350,1,11,0.212222,uh i'm most proud of being able to 
350,1,11,0.351429,have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and
350,1,11,0.246364,help someone else improve and better themself as well  
350,1,11,0.285000,goodbye 
374,0,2,0.820000,<synch>
374,0,2,0.390000,yes
374,0,2,0.195000,pretty good
374,0,2,0.530000,alexandria virginia
374,0,2,0.410000,mhm
374,0,2,0.313333,uh i moved to l_a uh
374,0,2,0.220000,end of two thousand one
374,0,2,0.310000,yeah it's crazy <laughter>
374,0,2,0.750000,um
374,0,2,0.308889,a couple times a year usually like for holidays
374,0,2,0.535556,hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um
374,0,2,0.205714,i think it's a lot more mellow
374,0,2,0.506667,um it's way more like suburbia
374,0,2,0.480000,it's nice
374,0,2,0.310909,um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>
374,0,2,0.308750,i went to um grad school at u_s_c
374,0,2,0.399333,um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in
374,0,2,0.500000,was so intense that
374,0,2,0.322000,like for the first year
374,0,2,0.291290,it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so
374,0,2,0.202000,that made it kind of
374,0,2,0.257879,um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so
374,0,2,0.163333,it wasn't bad
374,0,2,0.360000,film
374,0,2,0.401333,hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad
374,0,2,0.228750,i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do
374,0,2,0.680000,and um
374,0,2,0.228095,just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about
374,0,2,0.585000,and um
374,0,2,0.262667,i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school
374,0,2,0.267073,um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle>
374,0,2,0.460000,<sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um
374,0,2,0.382500,i think that uh
374,0,2,0.312778,i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of
374,0,2,0.575000,what um
374,0,2,0.222973,i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable
374,0,2,0.460000,um you know full time
374,0,2,0.420833,nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry
374,0,2,0.610000,um
374,0,2,0.243333,and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know
374,0,2,0.301765,what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting
374,0,2,0.292500,um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good
374,0,2,0.322222,place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a
374,0,2,0.353000,like room to to grow and advance and all that
374,0,2,0.280000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,0.320000,yeah
374,0,2,0.522500,<laughter> i can't see your shoes um i
374,0,2,0.392000,i like to travel um
374,0,2,0.270952,i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past
374,0,2,0.150000,done a fair amount
374,0,2,0.920000,um
374,0,2,0.333333,i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people
374,0,2,0.313600,um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know
374,0,2,0.440000,see
374,0,2,0.660000,beautiful remarkable
374,0,2,0.384737,places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle>
374,0,2,0.810000,um
374,0,2,0.222727,let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago
374,0,2,0.700000,um
374,0,2,0.265714,my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably
374,0,2,0.192000,that might be like my
374,0,2,0.340952,favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful
374,0,2,0.530000,um
374,0,2,0.266000,and we just spent like
374,0,2,0.303077,we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing
374,0,2,0.233750,and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like
374,0,2,0.290476,we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of
374,0,2,0.244000,it hit all of the
374,0,2,0.394706,you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also
374,0,2,0.248667,i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything
374,0,2,0.400000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,0.450000,<laughter>
374,0,2,0.268571,what do i do to relax um
374,0,2,0.800000,<sigh>
374,0,2,0.253462,i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will
374,0,2,0.180000,you know
374,0,2,0.276316,kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way
374,0,2,0.590000,um
374,0,2,0.264286,if i'm home i might just like
374,0,2,0.155000,you know
374,0,2,0.266190,throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like
374,0,2,0.575000,sort of escape relief
374,0,2,0.310000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,0.341429,um pretty good i don't i mean
374,0,2,0.208667,eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often
374,0,2,0.250000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,1.070000,um
374,0,2,0.306842,the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>
374,0,2,1.180000,um
374,0,2,0.323000,i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was
374,0,2,0.425000,like judging me unfairly
374,0,2,0.222500,and that was upsetting
374,0,2,0.475000,yeah <laughter>
374,0,2,0.600000,um
374,0,2,0.257037,it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to
374,0,2,0.190000,my mom on the phone probably like once a week and
374,0,2,0.392857,my parents are really supportive <sigh> um
374,0,2,0.580000,they are
374,0,2,0.225200,you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time
374,0,2,0.186250,um so i'd say we have a pretty
374,0,2,0.276667,pretty good relationship
374,0,2,0.443077,<deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>
374,0,2,0.327143,i guess because i'm like in this
374,0,2,0.387500,sort of job hunting
374,0,2,0.358889,phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like
374,0,2,0.286111,doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've
374,0,2,0.291739,sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>
374,0,2,0.565000,<deep breath> um <sigh>
374,0,2,0.425556,usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good
374,0,2,0.237778,i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out
374,0,2,0.366667,but um i've just had more
374,0,2,0.600000,uh
374,0,2,0.330000,like nights where
374,0,2,0.270000,it either
374,0,2,0.203043,takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason
374,0,2,0.700000,um
374,0,2,0.296650,i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know
374,0,2,0.342500,not that i have been able to identify
374,0,2,0.280500,i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like
374,0,2,0.318000,in flux but
374,0,2,0.205556,i i don't know there was no like event
374,0,2,0.320000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,0.349091,cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good
374,0,2,0.480000,feeling
374,0,2,0.300000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,0.514000,um
374,0,2,0.453333,not really no
374,0,2,0.474000,yes
374,0,2,0.465000,<deep breath>
374,0,2,0.810000,um <sigh>
374,0,2,0.815000,like <sigh>
374,0,2,0.140000,i think in like
374,0,2,0.410000,october or november
374,0,2,0.186842,although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like
374,0,2,0.340000,many many years ago <sniffle>
374,0,2,0.920000,um
374,0,2,0.424000,i felt like i was
374,0,2,0.251333,a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it
374,0,2,0.220000,<sniffle>
374,0,2,1.040000,um <sigh>
374,0,2,0.326800,just having a hard time
374,0,2,0.418000,functioning on the most basic
374,0,2,0.536667,level like just
374,0,2,0.606667,getting up and
374,0,2,0.400000,taking a shower
374,0,2,0.276286,and like going to the grocery store
374,0,2,0.446667,and you know
374,0,2,0.432000,answering emails was just like
374,0,2,0.500000,it took so much energy
374,0,2,0.500000,um
374,0,2,0.282500,so yeah i just i wasn't  really
374,0,2,0.747000,functioning normally
374,0,2,0.102000, yeah
374,0,2,0.510000,yes
374,0,2,0.690000,yes um
374,0,2,0.269167,<laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so
374,0,2,0.351667,<deep breath> i think that therapy
374,0,2,0.451667,is good for me because it
374,0,2,0.449000,helps me focus on
374,0,2,0.484000,my sort of patterns um
374,0,2,0.573333,and also like
374,0,2,0.200000,ah
374,0,2,0.397838,just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like
374,0,2,0.550000,um
374,0,2,0.511250,kind of just reacting to situations i'm like
374,0,2,0.140000,mm
374,0,2,0.471111,just like noticing more what is going on um
374,0,2,0.288000,and it just helps to
374,0,2,0.560000,um
374,0,2,0.207300,i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>
374,0,2,0.775000,<deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um
374,0,2,0.485000,i don't know um
374,0,2,0.337143,i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um
374,0,2,0.520000,eh maybe over uh
374,0,2,0.342500,over christmas being at home with my family
374,0,2,0.300000,yeah
374,0,2,0.770000,um
374,0,2,0.305000,well it just was
374,0,2,0.350000,that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then
374,0,2,0.555000,and um
374,0,2,0.255455,like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of
374,0,2,0.500000,feeling
374,0,2,0.310000,not
374,0,2,0.371905,<laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me
374,0,2,0.560000,um
374,0,2,0.314000,so when i was there with them it just um
374,0,2,0.272000,it just felt very like
374,0,2,0.333636,safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know
374,0,2,0.666667,warm familial embrace
374,0,2,0.360000,<laughter>
374,0,2,0.300000,<laughter>
374,0,2,1.080000,um <sigh>
374,0,2,0.513750,<laughter> i think she would describe me as
374,0,2,0.540000,funny
374,0,2,0.340000,and smart
374,0,2,0.610000,and
374,0,2,0.770000,um
374,0,2,0.293333,a good listener
374,0,2,1.110000,nonjudgmental
374,0,2,0.790000,um
374,0,2,0.535000,i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>
374,0,2,0.830000,<deep breath> hmm <sigh>
374,0,2,0.650000,okay um
374,0,2,0.800000,so
374,0,2,0.520000,this happened
374,0,2,0.437500,the the last like
374,0,2,0.242917,job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like
374,0,2,0.261818,a year and a half close to two years and uh
374,0,2,0.287200,i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>
374,0,2,0.220000,he sort of out of nowhere
374,0,2,0.780000,uh
374,0,2,0.518182,mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um
374,0,2,0.420000,essentially like
374,0,2,0.220000,the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project
374,0,2,0.216735,so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah
374,0,2,0.207059,and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer
374,0,2,0.235000,and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how
374,0,2,0.530000,he
374,0,2,0.245484,i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know
374,0,2,0.180000,even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore
374,0,2,0.252500,he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic
374,0,2,0.319231,decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me
374,0,2,0.235769,but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic
374,0,2,0.456667,yada yada so
374,0,2,0.248667,to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me
374,0,2,0.264583,um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point
374,0,2,0.298750,he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me
374,0,2,0.290000,and later on like a couple of months down the road
374,0,2,0.201579,i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still
374,0,2,0.252000,ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um
374,0,2,0.420000,this guy who
374,0,2,0.195556,had worked with us a bunch kind of like
374,0,2,0.235714,if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff
374,0,2,0.358333,he was doing my job so
374,0,2,0.282000,yeah so it just like
374,0,2,0.228621,it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like
374,0,2,0.270000,that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like
374,0,2,0.214000,in a way that's like
374,0,2,0.293333,that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like
374,0,2,0.274000,angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>
374,0,2,0.635000,<deep breath> um <sigh> let's see
374,0,2,0.445000,i um
374,0,2,0.472857,a very loyal person <deep breath> um
374,0,2,0.465000,i am
374,0,2,0.645714,smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um
374,0,2,0.602500,very like caring kind
374,0,2,0.770000,um
374,0,2,0.560000,i'm conscientious
374,0,2,0.444000,and i work hard <sniffle>
374,0,2,1.710000,<laughter> uh
374,0,2,0.510000,man
374,0,2,0.340000,i think
374,0,2,0.475000,to uh
374,0,2,0.440000,be more confident
374,0,2,0.740000,and
374,0,2,0.580000,less passive
374,0,2,0.720000,um
374,0,2,0.505000,to really
374,0,2,0.470000,like focus on
374,0,2,0.242647,what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>
374,0,2,0.893333,hmm <sigh> um
374,0,2,0.466000,probably just some of the
374,0,2,0.373333,relationships that i formed with people
374,0,2,0.560000,um
374,0,2,0.340000,just like really
374,0,2,0.532500,you know deep friendships

415,0,3,1.150000,um
415,0,3,0.706667,everything was memorable but probably jet-skiing

415,0,3,0.710000,outgoing

415,0,3,0.257273,music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel if i put music on it makes it much better
415,0,3,0.247556,i'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go to the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like

415,0,3,0.254704,and i know that it could've been prevented if we would've just sat down and talked to each other but it didn't make it that far so
415,0,3,0.300000,yeah
415,0,3,0.840000,um

415,0,3,0.275484,i always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years just the mere fact of almost losing him

333,0,5,0.290000,um probably took a year or two 
333,0,5,0.338182,uh you know being away from my family being away from
333,0,5,0.335455,what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here
333,0,5,0.210000,uh the weather 
333,0,5,0.257647,you can't beat the weather it's generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold
333,0,5,0.325455,uh it's creative i do like uh you know movies 
333,0,5,0.244000,uh like the beach 
333,0,5,0.425000,the traffic
333,0,5,0.282000,it's a lot of traffic
333,0,5,0.215000,uh

333,0,5,0.196667,i was a history major

333,0,5,0.473333,uh high-end supermarkets
333,0,5,0.250000,uh to be a screenwriter 
333,0,5,0.171667,that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles 
333,0,5,0.401667,um it's hard 'cause i don't always maintain uh focus and motivation
333,0,5,0.321667,i let other things distract me
333,0,5,0.380000,<laughter> 
333,0,5,0.246250,uh i was uh i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child
333,0,5,0.247500,and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination  
333,0,5,0.380000,uh i've in the last
333,0,5,0.520000,probably
333,0,5,0.229615,almost ten years i've traveled more than i had in the past <pa> well i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around
333,0,5,0.265000,so yes
333,0,5,0.358333,seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live 
333,0,5,0.365000,and taking in the sights 
333,0,5,0.269583,uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and  
333,0,5,0.373810,just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible  
333,0,5,0.280000,oh yeah that's one the great experiences of my life
333,0,5,0.204286,and i also got to uh 
333,0,5,0.280833,a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip
333,0,5,0.282500,um called uh 
333,0,5,0.213333,sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that
333,0,5,0.278000,egypt would but it was just amazing i went <we> i didn't go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling 
333,0,5,0.255625,what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music
333,0,5,0.312500,i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax 'cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind
333,0,5,0.422000,i do meditate every day
333,0,5,0.287273,um i like to take walks in nature that's always calming
333,0,5,0.201250,especially down by the uh the ocean 
333,0,5,0.600000,uh
333,0,5,0.416111,what i it depends <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times
333,0,5,0.210000,uh 
333,0,5,0.298500,i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do 
333,0,5,0.198000,which is very helpful 
333,0,5,0.317143,and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past
333,0,5,0.271250,some things that makes me really mad 
333,0,5,0.344286,i guess uh think of injustice 
333,0,5,0.432500,in the world or done to people when
333,0,5,0.470000,uh
333,0,5,0.188000,it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along 
333,0,5,0.185000,um 
333,0,5,0.266667,and and make the world better
333,0,5,0.413636,<laughter> uh last night i went to a movie screening 
333,0,5,0.219167,of a independent film and i didn't think it was done very well it's not so much that we had a fun argument 
333,0,5,0.310000,about uh about the movie 
333,0,5,0.247778,so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind 
333,0,5,0.630000,<laughter>
333,0,5,0.390000,is there anything i regret yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life
333,0,5,0.264000,that i wished i had
333,0,5,0.278571,uh taken them and pursued them 
333,0,5,0.360000,uh certain jobs
333,0,5,0.234375,you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh 
333,0,5,0.286667,become a grip
333,0,5,0.326000,and uh and i i probably should've pursued that 
333,0,5,0.238571,how did i decide it to do that i don't really understand the questions
333,0,5,0.252000,take advantage of every opportunity that came my way 
333,0,5,0.248750,to always <alway> i think saying yes 
333,0,5,0.314615,uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter  
333,0,5,0.185238,how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you wanna do 
333,0,5,0.360000,no
333,0,5,0.330000,no
333,0,5,0.258889,no but i've been depressed in my life 
333,0,5,0.245556,uh for the most part i've i've been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh
333,0,5,0.238462,i think you know sometimes if i if i allow <allo> allow a
333,0,5,0.302500,regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly 
333,0,5,0.557143,uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh 
333,0,5,0.367500,an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there 
333,0,5,0.222000,sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different 
333,0,5,0.275000,um 
333,0,5,0.300000,not really i mean i i feel 
333,0,5,0.240000,pretty much the same
333,0,5,0.335714,what got me to seek help for <laughter> let's come back to that 
333,0,5,0.303333,um i've well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that 
333,0,5,0.273000,uh pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping 
333,0,5,0.170000,uh 
333,0,5,0.385500,usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable  
333,0,5,0.420000,uh 
333,0,5,0.354286,how would my best friend describe me
333,0,5,0.368000,that's a good question um friendly <f> well i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive
333,0,5,0.372500,um i would probably that i should be
333,0,5,0.240000,they'd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier  
333,0,5,0.440000,i think um 
333,0,5,0.271667,it it it's tough it depends
333,0,5,0.296000,sometimes i'm very introverted 'cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with
333,0,5,0.282632,as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood 
333,0,5,0.577500,my best qualities um
333,0,5,0.315556,i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent 
333,0,5,0.377143,uh i think i'm funny i'm outgoing
333,0,5,0.340000,um

333,0,5,0.147143,you know people have said that 
333,0,5,0.358333,um i'm engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging there's a sort of a cool detachment 
333,0,5,0.580000,um
333,0,5,0.505000,and creative intuitive 
333,0,5,0.357500,<laughter> yes <laughter>

333,0,5,0.330000,um 
333,0,5,0.163000,i think that like i said going to kenya 
333,0,5,0.301290,was a memorable experience i do remember <remem> scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean 
333,0,5,0.210000,you know
333,0,5,0.279000,and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back 
333,0,5,0.290000,um

395,0,7,0.396000,um grumpy and and lethargic and um in the morning
395,0,7,0.322222,hmm a situation i wish i would handle differently
395,0,7,0.720000,um
395,0,7,0.180000,i really can't think of one right now
395,0,7,0.416364,<laughter> the hardest decision um that i've ever had to make
395,0,7,0.500909,it was probably um deciding to not have a a child
395,0,7,0.586250,well um i was pregnant um and um
395,0,7,0.351667,wasn't sure <sigh> whether or not i should continue the pregancy um
395,0,7,0.404000,and that was also due to financial burden and um
395,0,7,0.256500,the father who i was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision
395,0,7,0.560000,hmm
395,0,7,0.516667,<deep breath> really really happy <sigh>
395,0,7,0.444167,i know when i went to um cancun um on a holiday um over the new year um new year period new year holiday
395,0,7,0.641429,<deep breath> i felt <sigh> absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed um
395,0,7,0.303333,i felt like i didn't have a care in the world temporarily
395,0,7,0.690000,um
395,0,7,0.270000,eh free
395,0,7,0.400000,<deep breath>
395,0,7,0.501667,um i wish i could um
395,0,7,0.437500,be a little bit stronger and more assertive
395,0,7,0.360000,definitely more assertive
395,0,7,0.487778,um i would say i'm a wonderful wonderful friend
395,0,7,0.740000,um
395,0,7,0.378750,mm i when i love somebody you know i love them very deeply friends family um
395,0,7,0.720000,boyfriend
395,0,7,0.243333,um so i think that's good i'm very loyal as a friend
395,0,7,0.491429,um i'm honest i care about people
395,0,7,0.760000,um
395,0,7,0.267333,i'm fun to be with so i think those are some of my best qualities
395,0,7,0.464375,<deep breath> um my relationship with my family um with my father is not so great
395,0,7,0.310000,um my parents were divorced when i was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever
395,0,7,0.376667,uh mostly out
395,0,7,0.357222,so that's um it's not fantastic but um but it's something that i'm used to so it's not
395,0,7,0.274091,as painful as it would be had he been there and then i lost him but it's it's still it's still um
395,0,7,0.304118,it's still not the best situation i mean i still wish that could be um remedied somehow
395,0,7,7.620000,scrubbed_entry
395,0,7,0.287000,so there's good and and bad relationships in my family
395,0,7,6.140000,scrubbed_entry
395,0,7,0.226667,someone that's been there for me since i was very very young
395,0,7,0.392500,and has always been just incredible and i love her so much
395,0,7,0.398889,<deep breath> um ten or twenty years ago um
395,0,7,0.292174,i would've told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so i don't have to work so hard now
395,0,7,0.376667,i i regret exactly that i regret um not taking my career seriously earlier on
395,0,7,0.407143,um because now it's it's been um
395,0,7,0.245000,it's been much harder
395,0,7,0.810000,um
395,0,7,0.400000,i think it was taking the kids to the pier um and spending some wonderful time with them
395,0,7,0.407500,and making them happy
395,0,7,0.210000,that was probably a great time um one of the best times in the last few weeks
395,0,7,4.420000,scrubbed_entry
395,0,7,0.560000,and uh
395,0,7,0.300000,and they're they're great kids
395,0,7,0.410000,um no i think the they're it's challenging
395,0,7,0.362308,um it is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some um
395,0,7,0.292105,times when i'm not sure exactly how much um to get involved and how much not to get involved
395,0,7,0.294500,but i'm we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but um
395,0,7,0.222353,but i but it's not as difficult as um as i think some other parents have it
395,0,7,0.420000,mhm
395,0,7,0.295000,<deep breath>
395,0,7,0.275000,um i made it make a make a conscious effort
395,0,7,0.586667,not to um
395,0,7,0.481111,<laughter> not to punish them um or over-punish them
395,0,7,0.249259,i make a conscious decision not to um scream at them the way that i was screamed at i was screamed at a lot as a child
395,0,7,0.255294,and um it was really it was really difficult so i make sure not to do that
395,0,7,0.441333,um i think i'm most proud of the fact that i've um been able to
395,0,7,0.515000,travel the world um
395,0,7,0.361765,and live in other places many many other places um around the country and around the world
395,0,7,0.685000,and um
395,0,7,0.477500,the fact that um i learned several languages
395,0,7,0.650000,um
395,0,7,0.244000,and the fact that i've been able to maintain um
395,0,7,0.397500,really long long long relationships with my friends
395,0,7,0.280000,thank you
395,0,7,0.580000,goodbye

392,0,1,0.186667,i'm doing well
392,0,1,0.605000,uh california
392,0,1,0.301250,i like the weather i like the people
392,0,1,0.354444,i don't like the traffic uh that's primarily it
392,0,1,0.930000,sociology
392,0,1,0.270000,yep
392,0,1,0.248235,uh it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects
392,0,1,0.380000,no
392,0,1,0.182500,to be a writer
392,0,1,0.660000,um
392,0,1,0.261667,i like being able to write what i want to write uh right now i write things that i'm not really that interested in
392,0,1,0.614000,like uh articles about uh
392,0,1,0.865000,teenager culture
392,0,1,0.226667,stuff like that
392,0,1,0.880000,um
392,0,1,0.216250,i think they have it pretty easy they don't know how easy they have it <laughter>
392,0,1,0.362500,uh no not really
392,0,1,0.235938,mm depends on the situation or who i'm around when i first meet people i can be shy uh but if it's someone i've known for a while i can be outgoing
392,0,1,0.396364,um i'll lay down or try some sort like deep breathing
392,0,1,0.297333,or uh just maybe do something that's kinda fun and mind numbing like watch t_v
392,0,1,0.316667,i'm pretty good i don't really let anger show that much um
392,0,1,0.238824,i'm not like a i don't have a fiery temper or anything like that i'm pretty rational
392,0,1,0.680000,um
392,0,1,0.222778,i actually can't remember when the last time i argued with someone was 'cause it's been so long
392,0,1,0.680000,um
392,0,1,0.179000,i guess i feel guilty about the fact that i don't talk to my grandparents as much as i should
392,0,1,0.332143,um i'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family
392,0,1,0.362308,uh 'cause they basically sort of raised me uh and uh my parents
392,0,1,0.220000,weren't
392,0,1,0.181667,really in the picture that much
392,0,1,0.420000,um <sigh>
392,0,1,0.278333,i can't really think of one
392,0,1,0.295000,right now
392,0,1,0.610000,uh
392,0,1,0.345455,i guess uh when my sister died it was really traumatizing
392,0,1,0.260000,mhm
392,0,1,0.340000,yeah
392,0,1,0.430000,yes
392,0,1,0.640000,um
392,0,1,0.272105,i guess the hardest decision i've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband
392,0,1,0.301667,uh because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but i still felt like i should stick it out
392,0,1,0.245000,i mean it was hard at the time uh but
392,0,1,0.248571,i made the right decision i think
392,0,1,0.313636,uh my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age
392,0,1,0.511429,um she's just a very strong powerful
392,0,1,0.420000,uh sort of staunch character
392,0,1,0.170000,and that rubbed off on me
392,0,1,0.635000,uh not really super easy um
392,0,1,0.243750,i sort of i mean it's my probably my fault i go to bed too late
392,0,1,0.343333,just sort of foggy and distracted
392,0,1,0.290000,i have trouble concentrating
392,0,1,0.312000,you mean like my body

392,0,1,0.453077,uh probably funny and uh easy to get along with but also caring
392,0,1,0.295833,uh i spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies watching t_v
392,0,1,0.770000,uh
392,0,1,0.360000,no
392,0,1,0.200000,i don't think
392,0,1,0.219000,there's not i don't <do> i don't think uh i think regretting <r> regretting things is a waste of time
392,0,1,0.710000,um
392,0,1,0.595000,don't  try to
392,0,1,0.204545,don't go out of your way to try and impress people
392,0,1,0.190000,if
392,0,1,0.188571,they like you then they like you
392,0,1,0.520000,um

392,0,1,0.285000,sometimes i can be kinda lazy
392,0,1,0.460000,uh
392,0,1,0.231538,i'd like to have more of a um like sort of  uh
392,0,1,0.322000,better work ethic i guess
392,0,1,0.332400,uh just sort of putting off stuff um until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that um  procrastinating
392,0,1,0.460000,uh <sigh>
392,0,1,0.324783,sometimes for the things that i write uh people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website
392,0,1,0.138333,and that'll make me feel bad
392,0,1,0.350000,<laughter>
392,0,1,0.603333,i'm uh articulate
392,0,1,0.711667,and funny and a good friend
392,0,1,0.500000,um

436,0,0,0.285455,different things that you could get into that's not that positive
436,0,0,0.230833,and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff
436,0,0,0.248043,well normally i just knock out it's not that hard it's like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but

436,0,0,0.298000,i been well i been uh feeling good you know
436,0,0,0.219286,been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so
436,0,0,0.196429,i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel
436,0,0,0.270000,no
436,0,0,0.224000,nothing out of the ordinary
436,0,0,0.190000,no
436,0,0,0.200000,no
436,0,0,0.187143,the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a
436,0,0,0.292143,going out have some fun and you know i was drinking and just relaxing
436,0,0,0.188000,and winding <win> winding down
436,0,0,0.210000,mhm
436,0,0,0.299333,my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax
436,0,0,0.232857,but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home
436,0,0,0.256522,but without getting any calls or xxx interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just
436,0,0,0.180000,be with her doing the other different things
436,0,0,0.220000,mhm
436,0,0,0.268182,uh like an outgoing guy you know very social but at the same time i'm reserved depending how i feel with people
436,0,0,0.229091,have to you know build trust or feel comfortable with them
436,0,0,0.211250,oh i'm changing a lot you know like
436,0,0,0.376667,uh my temper and different things drinking things i'm
436,0,0,0.185385,changing a little different things so i could get more different things done
436,0,0,0.383333,oh there's several but mostly uh
436,0,0,0.265172,is when i'm coming from mexico that they wanna demeander you even down there it feels uh like silly because i went to a store i was regularly dressed
436,0,0,0.201333,and i was telling 'em i wanted to buy something and then they said that
436,0,0,0.234242,that i i wasn't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card they kinda changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo they know i was american
436,0,0,0.143750,but they thought it was like you know
436,0,0,0.193295,it it was <wa> it felt me it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money you ask for something you're gonna ask for something because you have it not just to waste <wa> kill their time
436,0,0,0.205556,just because they saw a logo of a card
436,0,0,0.146000,that's how they you know

436,0,0,0.264138,and you know don't go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then it'd be different

433,1,10,0.232000,to own a barber shop

433,1,10,0.272500,since she wouldn't make up her mind kinda made me
433,1,10,0.620000,uneasy
433,1,10,0.369687,probably just to relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice
433,1,10,0.421111,wrongdoings in my past basically anything i could've changed
433,1,10,0.302500,mm to better myself

433,1,10,0.740000,pretty horrific
433,1,10,0.635000,scary experience

433,1,10,0.302188,and the car spun out and it basically almost ended up off of a little hill
433,1,10,0.262222,it was a pretty scary experience as far as

433,1,10,0.733333,more advanced thinking
433,1,10,0.240000,compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the the old age
433,1,10,0.247143,they learn things a little more quicker
433,1,10,0.475000,uh no not majorly
433,1,10,0.210000,just things that i could've thought i could've done

433,1,10,0.334286,find a way to be more easygoing
433,1,10,0.283333,maybe try to
433,1,10,0.287059,not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder

476,0,3,0.680000,i
476,0,3,0.334375,was told i'm a part time member in this band and i was told that uh
476,0,3,0.234762,you know i wasn't officially in the core group and stuff i felt pretty bad about that for a few days
476,0,3,0.296667,it's alright <laughter>
476,0,3,0.520000,uh
476,0,3,0.460000,in life
476,0,3,0.418889,maybe going maybe finishing college that might be something
476,0,3,0.220000,not
476,0,3,0.630000,um
476,0,3,0.205000,i don't know i just never
476,0,3,0.230000,i i never came to pass that i would transfer to
476,0,3,0.375556,a four year university and get a bachelor's degree
476,0,3,0.360000,best qualities i think
476,0,3,0.637500,generally that easygoingness and
476,0,3,0.267500,good sense of humor
476,0,3,0.244286,i did recently that i really enjoyed
476,0,3,0.378125,last weekend i went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends that was nice
476,0,3,0.300000,yeah
476,0,3,0.332500,most proud of um
476,0,3,0.305238,i guess you know musical accomplishments i've put a lot of work into that and i'm finding success in my way
476,0,3,0.340000,<laughter>
476,0,3,0.210000,thank you
476,0,3,0.232000,thank you that was interesting
476,0,3,0.350000,goodbye
488,0,0,0.850000,<synch>
488,0,0,0.760000,yes
488,0,0,0.460000,fine
488,0,0,0.340000,oh san fernando valley
488,0,0,0.270400,uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around
488,0,0,0.306000,it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system
488,0,0,0.330769,uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel
488,0,0,0.378500,um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class
488,0,0,0.177500,yeah it was fun
488,0,0,0.585000,hmm <sigh>
488,0,0,0.315000,i think it's tough to say
488,0,0,0.295263,um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley
488,0,0,0.272632,and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night
488,0,0,0.640000,philosophy
488,0,0,0.660000,yes
488,0,0,0.790000,um
488,0,0,0.840000,hmm
488,0,0,0.246061,i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked
488,0,0,0.286667,all the different
488,0,0,0.278182,ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy
488,0,0,0.820000,huh
488,0,0,0.364167,i don't know but i really like children and i really like
488,0,0,0.291538,studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it
488,0,0,0.305455,i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i
488,0,0,0.232000,i think i'm pretty friendly
488,0,0,0.311000,um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read
488,0,0,0.920000,um
488,0,0,0.250000,yeah
488,0,0,0.244667,i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about
488,0,0,0.441111,other things if i start getting mad or um
488,0,0,0.240000,i just start trying to focus on my breathing
488,0,0,0.280667,i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend
488,0,0,0.393333,um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um
488,0,0,0.290000,i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party
488,0,0,0.266000,and he was getting frustrated
488,0,0,0.235000,which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with
488,0,0,0.390000,well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and
488,0,0,0.480000,i
488,0,0,0.297826,really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out
488,0,0,0.860000,hmm
488,0,0,0.242500,i think a lot of times when my
488,0,0,0.435000,oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother
488,0,0,0.324375,uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close
488,0,0,0.248182,as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i
488,0,0,0.250357,and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him
488,0,0,0.590000,hmm
488,0,0,0.990000,um
488,0,0,0.335000,when i was nineteen
488,0,0,0.586667,i came home
488,0,0,0.283333,from a party
488,0,0,0.237586,i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things
488,0,0,0.207273,and then he didn't speak to me for about a year
488,0,0,0.216111,uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home
488,0,0,0.229286,um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could
488,0,0,0.745000,um <sigh>
488,0,0,0.415000,and i love my siblings i
488,0,0,0.291818,again my little sister and i get along really well she's
488,0,0,0.242000,four years younger than me
488,0,0,0.790000,and when
488,0,0,0.255926,when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and
488,0,0,0.465000,i wasn't
488,0,0,0.240000,in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore
488,0,0,0.262500,and that's really great
488,0,0,0.850000,and
488,0,0,0.385714,we get along okay with my uh
488,0,0,0.325000,my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve
488,0,0,3.570000,scrubbed_entry
488,0,0,0.265600,one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good
488,0,0,0.285833,uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and
488,0,0,0.351250,who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that
488,0,0,0.278667,i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but
488,0,0,0.166316,generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning
488,0,0,0.860000,um
488,0,0,0.348750,well i'm really tired i can get grumpy
488,0,0,0.343333,but i think usually i'm just
488,0,0,0.760000,groggy
488,0,0,0.354286,pretty good i'm a little anxious about
488,0,0,0.620000,um
488,0,0,0.306667,about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about
488,0,0,0.196667,it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time
488,0,0,0.700000,um
488,0,0,0.250000,yeah
488,0,0,0.600000,<sigh> well
488,0,0,0.198837,i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic
488,0,0,0.570000,no
488,0,0,0.560000,no
488,0,0,0.650000,hmm
488,0,0,0.310000,well i think the last time i felt really happy i
488,0,0,0.318333,went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party
488,0,0,0.815000,and um
488,0,0,0.231250,i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people
488,0,0,0.219231,and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun
488,0,0,0.483333,um she would probably say that
488,0,0,0.892500,i'm smart and uh
488,0,0,0.394444,pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch
488,0,0,0.393333,really like serious films and t_v
488,0,0,0.970000,um
488,0,0,0.191000,and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot
488,0,0,0.331765,well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so
488,0,0,0.383333,um so that's a major one that and procrastinating
488,0,0,0.240000,hmm
488,0,0,0.295455,um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh
488,0,0,0.645000,uh given
488,0,0,0.190000,eh
488,0,0,0.246774,sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was
488,0,0,0.258125,very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem
488,0,0,0.224375,like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock
488,0,0,0.318333,speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job
488,0,0,0.623333,but it was
488,0,0,0.310000,was not
488,0,0,0.327857,great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation
488,0,0,0.398000,well i would've been twelve
488,0,0,0.345000,and two
488,0,0,0.680000,um
488,0,0,0.426667,but i think
488,0,0,0.248519,i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think
488,0,0,0.321111,i was a little selfish and self-involved back then
488,0,0,0.201600,i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and
488,0,0,0.620000,um
488,0,0,0.310000,i do regret
488,0,0,0.313333,a couple of
488,0,0,0.283846,semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a
488,0,0,0.270667,a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript
488,0,0,0.390000,i think so i'm
488,0,0,0.150000,i think i
488,0,0,0.352500,i wasn't focusing in school at that time
488,0,0,0.243125,and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that
488,0,0,0.332143,hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then
488,0,0,0.342500,going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges
488,0,0,0.373333,and then maybe
488,0,0,0.476000,going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping
488,0,0,0.206250,and maybe watching a little bit of t_v
488,0,0,0.630000,huh
488,0,0,0.272632,well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up
488,0,0,0.248571,i'm ten years older than him so
488,0,0,0.238462,and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which
488,0,0,0.317500,made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and
488,0,0,0.323333,um and how close we are
417,0,7,1.110000,<sync>
417,0,7,0.770000,yes
417,0,7,0.460000,i'm okay
417,0,7,0.385000,uh los angeles <laughter>
417,0,7,0.396000,um i don't know <laughter>
417,0,7,1.050000,um
417,0,7,0.313333,it's kinda dirty but that's to be expected from a big city
417,0,7,0.325806,um my the last class that i took was a sociology class um i'm not <n> i'm not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education
417,0,7,0.327778,i think that it's a really important job um
417,0,7,0.380000,uh i feel like
417,0,7,0.526667,uh because there's kind of uh
417,0,7,0.368182,stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies
417,0,7,0.333000,so i feel like it's a very important job for
417,0,7,0.473333,the world <laughter>
417,0,7,0.280000,i don't know <laughter>
417,0,7,0.680000,no
417,0,7,0.497500,um lack of funds
417,0,7,0.338667,um it depends on the people but i'd say that uh generally i'm more shy
417,0,7,0.225556,uh of course with people who i know well
417,0,7,0.373333,like they're closer to me i i'm more outgoing
417,0,7,0.488000,um play with my dogs
417,0,7,0.790000,uh
417,0,7,0.246429,i don't know uh if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk
417,0,7,0.820000,um
417,0,7,0.272000,if it's not a nice day then or if it's cold out or something then
417,0,7,0.344000,uh maybe watch a show on t_v i like or read a book or something
417,0,7,0.244444,i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper
417,0,7,0.382500,um i can't remember i think the last person i argued with
417,0,7,0.563333,was my boyfriend
417,0,7,0.276923,probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter>
417,0,7,1.060000,um
417,0,7,0.381923,i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i'd say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret um
417,0,7,0.280000,like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad
417,0,7,0.385000,but regret is like
417,0,7,0.364000,um feeling like you should've made a different decision and
417,0,7,0.265714,i think that can help you in
417,0,7,0.289500,to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter>
417,0,7,1.210000,um
417,0,7,0.331667,i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school
417,0,7,1.140000,um
417,0,7,1.200000,uh
417,0,7,0.301667,i mean not getting better grades
417,0,7,0.960000,um
417,0,7,0.623333,i regret uh
417,0,7,0.394444,like getting involved with certain people in the past
417,0,7,0.264444,but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter>
417,0,7,0.184545,that's about it that i can think of right now <laughter>
417,0,7,0.470000,hm
417,0,7,1.000000,um
417,0,7,0.278889,uh yeah i mean i mean in the past
417,0,7,0.314000,uh yeah i could've made
417,0,7,0.830000,different decisions
417,0,7,0.360625,i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so
417,0,7,0.860000,um
417,0,7,0.257692,i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory
417,0,7,0.590000,but
417,0,7,0.247647,i wish that it didn't happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped
417,0,7,0.368000,<laughter> i can't really think of any hard decisions um
417,0,7,1.460000,hm
417,0,7,0.186667,i can't think of any <laughter>
417,0,7,0.840000,hm
417,0,7,0.254444,i'm not sure <laughter> i can't think of any
417,0,7,0.307273,uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um
417,0,7,0.385000,uh not
417,0,7,0.264118,i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well
417,0,7,0.383636,and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends
417,0,7,0.540000,um
417,0,7,0.880000,hm
417,0,7,0.326154,i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life
417,0,7,0.860000,uh
417,0,7,0.385000,because she was always able to provide for me and she always
417,0,7,0.223333,she didn't i mean she made
417,0,7,0.311176,like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it
417,0,7,0.420000,and um she just did her best to raise me so
417,0,7,0.287500,i think she was a big positive influence
417,0,7,0.556000,uh it's been easy lately
417,0,7,0.393750,uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh
417,0,7,0.431667,lately i have had no problems
417,0,7,0.720000,um
417,0,7,0.290000,it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just
417,0,7,0.387500,be anywhere from like
417,0,7,0.867500,groggy to like um
417,0,7,0.570000,really on edge
417,0,7,0.606667,and like um
417,0,7,0.345000,extremely tired <laughter> i don't know
417,0,7,0.382000,um i have been feeling
417,0,7,0.520000,pretty good i uh
417,0,7,0.346842,i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been
417,0,7,0.316667,in the past
417,0,7,0.760000,so
417,0,7,0.404000,been feeling mostly pretty good
417,0,7,0.325000,um i think that i've actually been feeling
417,0,7,0.895000,happier lately
417,0,7,0.269375,i wouldn't say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of
417,0,7,0.410000,like
417,0,7,0.850000,um
417,0,7,0.418333,neutral but i have been feeling
417,0,7,0.676667,more positive lately
417,0,7,0.405000,i'm actually not sure if i've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
417,0,7,1.040000,um
417,0,7,1.030000,uh
417,0,7,0.476154,i know that i i've been seeing uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like
417,0,7,0.340000,since i was sixteen
417,0,7,0.673333,um for depression

417,0,7,0.291429,talk someone and have them kind of
417,0,7,0.780000,um
417,0,7,0.540000,guide you in
417,0,7,0.327692,talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your
417,0,7,0.299375,feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something
417,0,7,0.310000,i mean
417,0,7,0.191818,i think sometimes you can do that on your own but
417,0,7,0.480000,uh
417,0,7,0.335000,talking to somebody helps i think
417,0,7,0.780000,um
417,0,7,0.980000,hm
417,0,7,0.322500,i'm not sure <laughter>

417,0,7,1.100000,uh
417,0,7,0.485714,i think i would spend it mostly
417,0,7,0.585000,at home
417,0,7,0.228000,um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit
417,0,7,0.502857,and i'd play with my dogs and
417,0,7,0.810000,uh
417,0,7,0.283333,i'd probably have my boyfriend over
417,0,7,1.100000,um
417,0,7,0.301667,i'd eat food that i like
417,0,7,0.363636,like only food that i like like my favorite foods um
417,0,7,0.810000,watch
417,0,7,0.341429,movie or t_v show that i like

417,0,7,0.445000,i would tell myself to uh
417,0,7,0.327059,to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever
417,0,7,0.335625,and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like
417,0,7,0.310000,sort of lose interest and then
417,0,7,0.392500,uh not do well
417,0,7,0.292857,or as well as i could have
417,0,7,0.316667,so i would tell myself to
417,0,7,0.247368,do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more
417,0,7,0.580000,than i do
417,0,7,0.229524,and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school
417,0,7,0.241818,so i would just tell myself to do good in school
417,0,7,0.357778,probably warn myself about one or two people that
417,0,7,0.362222,turned out to be not worth my time <laughter>

356,1,10,0.270000,i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences 
356,1,10,0.350000,oh
356,1,10,0.276250,well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school
356,1,10,0.215833,there was a few of the things that i was happy about
356,1,10,0.490000,and
356,1,10,0.330000,some art pieces i've made were memorable
356,1,10,0.235000,and 
356,1,10,0.340000,some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though 
356,1,10,0.245000,uh 
356,1,10,0.301952,well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family
356,1,10,0.394545,uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a
356,1,10,0.200000,uh there's a few that are from far <f>
356,1,10,0.193846,distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and  
356,1,10,0.254444,my other brother lives in maui <clears throat> 
356,1,10,0.380000,mhm
356,1,10,0.407500,oh mostly very talented
356,1,10,0.420833,<ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was
356,1,10,0.532000,or am and they're um
356,1,10,0.208462,i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up
356,1,10,0.278182,just seems like they were all hooked into social media 
356,1,10,0.355000,uh go on a walk or
356,1,10,0.370000,watch television 
356,1,10,0.266667,or play with my computer 
356,1,10,0.285000,and uh
356,1,10,0.476667,um well 
356,1,10,0.202500,there's some <so> some
356,1,10,0.185000,uh 
356,1,10,0.221667,there's some kind of uh 
356,1,10,0.496000,injustices that happen in not
356,1,10,0.393333,not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking
356,1,10,0.398462,eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna 
356,1,10,0.320000,uh make any exceptions or change some rules 
356,1,10,0.358571,and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups>
356,1,10,0.290000,uh that are upsetting
356,1,10,0.435000,uh yeah
356,1,10,0.245000,i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site  
356,1,10,0.294000,the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside 
356,1,10,0.303929,and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside
356,1,10,0.313793,um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained
356,1,10,0.385833,that we were late setting up when it when they told us
356,1,10,0.298333,to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and 
356,1,10,0.323043,and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so
356,1,10,0.314250,uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job 
356,1,10,0.225714,that's yeah that's how they do things
356,1,10,0.205000,so that that is upsetting 
356,1,10,0.372273,uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are
356,1,10,0.227500,that might be better
356,1,10,0.300000,um 
356,1,10,0.215000,yeah 
356,1,10,0.313333,uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx
356,1,10,0.319545,might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that
356,1,10,0.210769,but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that 
356,1,10,0.490000,um
356,1,10,0.274000,well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we
356,1,10,0.273750,we were arguing where to go first 
356,1,10,0.458333,and um so we compromised and
356,1,10,0.243846,did most of her things and one of my things then after 
356,1,10,0.216000,this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so
356,1,10,0.140000,but it
356,1,10,0.170000,yeah 
356,1,10,0.330000,no
356,1,10,0.314444,post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is 
356,1,10,0.590000,uh
356,1,10,0.260000,no i have not
356,1,10,0.220000,yes 
356,1,10,0.623333,oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty
356,1,10,0.270000,yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty
356,1,10,0.155000,yeah 
356,1,10,0.420000,um
356,1,10,0.339000,well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist 
356,1,10,0.520000,um
356,1,10,0.377273,well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house 
356,1,10,0.398333,um i was waking up at
356,1,10,0.443000,noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um
356,1,10,0.379000,focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough
356,1,10,0.346250,uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression 
356,1,10,0.174667,yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was 
356,1,10,0.380000,no
356,1,10,0.430000,uh well
356,1,10,0.283077,eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that 
356,1,10,0.306667,he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh
356,1,10,0.266250,and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on
356,1,10,0.382143,with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days 
356,1,10,0.530000,um
356,1,10,0.459000,i think therapy makes you see what the um 
356,1,10,0.269655,like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really
356,1,10,0.289375,you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of
356,1,10,0.387727,try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately 
356,1,10,0.351111,or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint
356,1,10,0.214545,and i try to look for clues about that  
356,1,10,0.355000,i think i'm um
356,1,10,0.384286,slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods
356,1,10,0.346923,i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for
356,1,10,0.280625,for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important
356,1,10,0.275000,it um
356,1,10,0.184000,it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and
356,1,10,0.296000,deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  
356,1,10,0.225000,uh 
356,1,10,0.287391,well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are
356,1,10,0.359286,probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i
356,1,10,0.258000,have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um
356,1,10,0.520000,um
356,1,10,0.301500,soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with 
356,1,10,0.150000,mm
356,1,10,0.238000,you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and 
356,1,10,0.247317,the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and
356,1,10,0.310000,eh things like that or um
356,1,10,0.345714,some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that 
356,1,10,0.206667,where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that 
356,1,10,0.284444,oh you mean in life in general yeah well
356,1,10,0.251176,i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa>
356,1,10,0.281875,uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well
356,1,10,0.537500,and um didn't really
356,1,10,0.300000,i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have
356,1,10,0.245000,um 
356,1,10,0.241250,i think it would've been to um 
356,1,10,0.424667,at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some
356,1,10,0.437500,uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics
356,1,10,0.213333,i had i was an art major and i had no car so  
356,1,10,0.230588,a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and
356,1,10,0.291579,and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to  
356,1,10,0.260000,do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time
356,1,10,0.170000,so 
356,1,10,0.260000,um 
356,1,10,0.226667,well i'm i've been told i'm very patient 
356,1,10,0.389167,and also i have um some original original artistic ideas  
356,1,10,0.230000,so 
356,1,10,0.426667,um those are

464,0,0,0.455000,cleaner bloodflow
464,0,0,0.440000,the um people
464,0,0,0.520000,culture
464,0,0,0.212857,and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends
464,0,0,0.455000,yeah um any time
464,0,0,0.170000,like right now
464,0,0,0.230000,or when
464,0,0,0.175625,okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples
464,0,0,0.242000,and um it started raining
464,0,0,0.212692,so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go
464,0,0,0.251667,the the smaller the steps get
464,0,0,0.550000,so
464,0,0,0.230000,like people back then had
464,0,0,0.260000,uh smaller feet
464,0,0,0.260000,so what happened was
464,0,0,0.280000,as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways
464,0,0,0.223636,so my feet could measure up to the the the steps
464,0,0,0.142000,but once you get up there it's a nice view
464,0,0,0.440000,i yeah
464,0,0,0.440000,uh general education but
464,0,0,0.350000,um mainly art
464,0,0,0.201818,yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes
464,0,0,0.565000,um well
464,0,0,0.142000,when i was a kid
464,0,0,0.229474,i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so
464,0,0,0.157500,i just pursued it
464,0,0,0.470000,so
464,0,0,0.270000,yeah
464,0,0,0.266667,my dream job
464,0,0,0.222857,would be to get paid for painting
464,0,0,0.315000,painting art
464,0,0,0.300000,yeah
464,0,0,0.470000,um
464,0,0,0.200000,yeah
464,0,0,0.310000,pretty simple
464,0,0,0.640000,um
464,0,0,0.333636,it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion
464,0,0,0.580000,um
464,0,0,0.770000,persistence
464,0,0,0.410000,and faith and will
464,0,0,0.214545,you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed
464,0,0,0.300000,mhm
464,0,0,0.315556,i consider myself to be shy in certain um
464,0,0,0.333333,time and places
464,0,0,0.271429,but i am also out outgoing when
464,0,0,0.246000,like i have the energy
464,0,0,0.530000,so
464,0,0,0.208750,i feel like it's well balanced you know
464,0,0,0.212000,like i'm shy when it's
464,0,0,0.265000,i guess
464,0,0,0.197500,okay to be shy
464,0,0,0.145000,you know
464,0,0,0.355000,and i'm outgoing when
464,0,0,0.250000,like the need to actually
464,0,0,0.353333,um have fun or just explore
464,0,0,0.282500,it feels good like
464,0,0,0.201667,if that makes sense but yeah
464,0,0,0.430000,<laughter>
464,0,0,0.330000,yeah
464,0,0,0.326667,to uh relax
464,0,0,0.610000,um
464,0,0,0.230667,either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter>
464,0,0,0.306667,so that helps
464,0,0,0.500000,and
464,0,0,0.255556,i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax
464,0,0,0.210000,you know especially when i use the color blue
464,0,0,0.295714,because the color blue um relaxes me
464,0,0,0.243333,and also green
464,0,0,0.204667,when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down
464,0,0,0.165000,yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah
464,0,0,0.270000,my temper
464,0,0,0.370000,um well my thoughts
464,0,0,0.332000,my thoughts control my emotions
464,0,0,0.473333,and my emotions
464,0,0,0.226000,yeah that's pretty much how
464,0,0,0.178750,my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad
464,0,0,0.184545,or if i do get mad what will be the outcome
464,0,0,0.150000,you know
464,0,0,0.540000,so
464,0,0,0.236000,controlling my temper is just
464,0,0,0.250000,by training my thought
464,0,0,0.560000,um <sigh>
464,0,0,0.314286,the last time i argued with somebody
464,0,0,0.258333,was with my with my father
464,0,0,0.202500,and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine
464,0,0,0.229412,so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no
464,0,0,0.250000,so that kinda frustrated me
464,0,0,0.600000,and
464,0,0,0.190000,the way i handled it was like well
464,0,0,0.212000,i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so
464,0,0,0.210000,you know
464,0,0,0.197692,and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace
464,0,0,0.310000,so
464,0,0,0.160000,yeah
464,0,0,0.295000,my family
464,0,0,0.290000,um it's pretty good
464,0,0,0.570000,um
464,0,0,0.281818,my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married
464,0,0,0.442000,and my brothers and sisters
464,0,0,0.301667,um we help one another out
464,0,0,0.274000,so that's good it's just
464,0,0,0.214000,yeah it's like a team
464,0,0,0.300000,a situation i wish i could handle differently would be
464,0,0,0.300000,hmm
464,0,0,0.225000,that's a good question
464,0,0,0.315000,i mean
464,0,0,0.202000,can i get a scenerio
464,0,0,0.410000,okay
464,0,0,0.910000,um
464,0,0,0.463333,a situation i could handle differently
464,0,0,0.163333,well see that's the thing like i feel like
464,0,0,0.211818,if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out
464,0,0,0.195000,you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube
464,0,0,0.410000,maybe
464,0,0,0.199000,how would i handle the situation would be just by
464,0,0,0.390000,uh failing um failing making mistakes
464,0,0,0.220000,because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after
464,0,0,0.420000,so
464,0,0,0.213333,that's the best way i could answer your question
464,0,0,0.145000,you know
464,0,0,0.430000,yeah
464,0,0,0.393333,a positive influence
464,0,0,0.330000,pretty much
464,0,0,0.258125,anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know
464,0,0,0.520000,like
464,0,0,0.210000,yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt
464,0,0,0.207778,well they're not trying to be mean they're actually
464,0,0,0.221250,good influences so i would say my friends
464,0,0,0.284000,uh my mom my dad
464,0,0,0.255000,my brother my sisters
464,0,0,0.290000,yeah
464,0,0,0.510000,mm
464,0,0,0.241667,well see that's the thing like
464,0,0,0.272105,you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife
464,0,0,0.205714,but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware
464,0,0,0.390000,and
464,0,0,0.178333,it taught me how to read people a little bit more like
464,0,0,0.213333,just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like
464,0,0,0.300000,scar me
464,0,0,0.205000,it did prepare me for like
464,0,0,0.217600,the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like
464,0,0,0.254000,you know like guns knives and all that stuff so
464,0,0,0.302000,it's it's bad but it's good in the long term
464,0,0,0.253333,you know because
464,0,0,0.188571,if you get out of that slump
464,0,0,0.305000,it's like
464,0,0,0.192500,nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know
464,0,0,0.430000,and
464,0,0,0.165000,so yeah
464,0,0,0.485000,the hardest
464,0,0,0.710000,um
464,0,0,0.390000,man
464,0,0,0.164615,this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it
464,0,0,0.257000,but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing
464,0,0,0.605000,life changing
464,0,0,0.317500,whether to continue school
464,0,0,0.520000,college
464,0,0,0.305000,or not
464,0,0,0.297500,mm i kinda chose
464,0,0,0.295000,to like
464,0,0,0.234167,i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like
464,0,0,0.193684,like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in
464,0,0,0.225000,so that was a hard choice because there was no
464,0,0,0.266000,um guarantee that i would
464,0,0,0.400000,like
464,0,0,0.201667,run into like the right people
464,0,0,0.195714,but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so
464,0,0,0.400000,yeah
464,0,0,0.380000,yeah
464,0,0,0.320000,yeah
464,0,0,0.508000,um it's actually really easy
464,0,0,0.235263,i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know
464,0,0,0.190769,i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down
464,0,0,0.272857,like like slow down my air pattern
464,0,0,0.360000,yeah
464,0,0,0.250000,mhm
464,0,0,0.610000,lately
464,0,0,0.463333,i've been feeling
464,0,0,0.420000,good
464,0,0,0.207500,i've been feeling like i have free will
464,0,0,0.248889,like at this point in time i feel like
464,0,0,0.365714,if i chose a path any path
464,0,0,0.365000,with like
464,0,0,0.205000,my heart
464,0,0,0.230000,i could
464,0,0,0.195000,get there you know
464,0,0,0.162000,but i'm kind of like
464,0,0,0.255714,still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air
464,0,0,0.156667,just trying to make my own i don't know
464,0,0,0.176364,that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will
464,0,0,0.230000,so yeah
464,0,0,0.211111,lately like in the past two weeks or today
464,0,0,0.420000,<laughter>
464,0,0,0.420000,okay
464,0,0,0.270000,uh yeah you know like
464,0,0,0.770000,um
464,0,0,0.280000,yeah
464,0,0,0.270000,things happen that would change like
464,0,0,0.380000,my feelings and
464,0,0,0.201429,for example right now it just happened
464,0,0,0.210000,huh
464,0,0,0.195000,for right now like
464,0,0,0.189231,this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought
464,0,0,0.640000,because
464,0,0,0.306667,yeah it's like
464,0,0,0.244615,it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far
464,0,0,0.420000,like
464,0,0,0.188000,one could take a thought
464,0,0,0.152500,and then make it
464,0,0,0.810000,reality
464,0,0,0.206667,so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now
464,0,0,0.340000,this experience this this whole experience
464,0,0,0.320000,yeah
464,0,0,0.440000,uh post traumatic stress disorder
464,0,0,0.300000,no
464,0,0,0.196667,depression i know how it's like to be depressed
464,0,0,0.335000,but diagnosed by a doctor no
464,0,0,0.465000,uh depression
464,0,0,0.620000,how
464,0,0,0.240000,how it feels
464,0,0,0.252000,how does depression feel like
464,0,0,0.290000,it feels like
464,0,0,0.177143,it's like a bird in a cage
464,0,0,0.350000,being depression is like
464,0,0,0.227000,being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water
464,0,0,0.211818,i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings
464,0,0,0.560000,um
464,0,0,0.350000,pretty much it feels
464,0,0,0.290000,like you're limited
464,0,0,0.222000,but then the thing is
464,0,0,0.200000,to get out of that depression
464,0,0,0.140000,it's like you have to
464,0,0,0.310000,awaken and change your perspective
464,0,0,0.353333,and focus on
464,0,0,0.306250,like i i would say colors colors help
464,0,0,0.276667,and people talking to people helps
464,0,0,0.350000,yeah
464,0,0,0.473333,um being depressed
464,0,0,0.396667,mm let's see
464,0,0,0.440000,mm
464,0,0,0.156667,i don't know
464,0,0,0.430000,like
464,0,0,0.211765,it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses
464,0,0,0.450000,so
464,0,0,0.250000,like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed
464,0,0,0.223750,but then what happened i fixed it like
464,0,0,0.182000,called up a friend and
464,0,0,0.296667,met up with him and yeah
464,0,0,0.263333,um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know
464,0,0,0.253333,i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool
464,0,0,0.450000,and
464,0,0,0.220000,yeah
464,0,0,0.182000,right now i feel happy
464,0,0,0.500000,<laughter>
464,0,0,0.610000,um
464,0,0,0.340000,sometimes hard headed
464,0,0,0.237500,like he would try to teach me um
464,0,0,0.300000,a certain lesson whether it's art
464,0,0,0.303333,or just like in my character
464,0,0,0.820000,and
464,0,0,0.185556,yeah he would probably just describe me as like
464,0,0,0.300000,like
464,0,0,0.300000,like
464,0,0,0.413333,he would listen
464,0,0,0.126923,but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do
464,0,0,0.330000,so pretty much like
464,0,0,0.203333,i don't know
464,0,0,0.166250,yeah i mean that's what he tells me
464,0,0,0.270000,but yeah overall good person
464,0,0,0.537500,um probably just exercise
464,0,0,0.425000,um my diet food
464,0,0,0.253333,my food intake
464,0,0,0.365000,and yeah just exercise
464,0,0,0.126667,pretty much it
464,0,0,0.305000,my health
464,0,0,0.750000,mm
464,0,0,0.248000,i would say when i was like in middle school
464,0,0,0.760000,or
464,0,0,0.435000,in elementary
464,0,0,0.135714,a little bit of high school too
464,0,0,0.162500,but what it would
464,0,0,0.285455,yeah what it would be was it would either be about
464,0,0,0.780000,um
464,0,0,0.275000,well pretty much my art <laughter>
464,0,0,0.178800,like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like
464,0,0,0.360000,like trash
464,0,0,0.185000,and then i'd be like oh
464,0,0,0.290000,damn
464,0,0,0.160000,either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it
464,0,0,0.255385,or what i would do back then would be like damn you know
464,0,0,0.260000,just kinda dwell on that thought
464,0,0,0.260000,and then just like
464,0,0,0.220000,stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it
464,0,0,0.215000,but yeah
464,0,0,0.310000,usually it's um people's words
464,0,0,0.480000,and ideas
464,0,0,0.370000,that
464,0,0,0.360000,yeah
464,0,0,0.200000,yeah so that's it
464,0,0,0.390000,regret
464,0,0,0.250000,um yeah i got a couple things i regret
464,0,0,0.185000,like what
464,0,0,0.410000,well
464,0,0,0.264545,sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing
464,0,0,0.580000,but
464,0,0,0.191111,i mean at the same time i feel like
464,0,0,0.181667,if i really wanted to go
464,0,0,0.287500,i would have gone
464,0,0,0.215000,so yeah
464,0,0,0.143750,that's kind of a regret in my head
464,0,0,0.344000,ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual
464,0,0,0.255000,well being
464,0,0,0.200000,you know
464,0,0,0.245000,learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself
464,0,0,0.560000,um
464,0,0,0.277619,pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment
464,0,0,0.261667,uh certain events you would experience
464,0,0,0.251429,and as far as your overall happiness
464,0,0,0.280000,yeah
464,0,0,0.238333,yeah among other things but yeah
464,0,0,0.210000,what i'm most proud of right now
464,0,0,0.490000,is my paintings
464,0,0,0.160000,yeah
464,0,0,0.203333,i'm proud of that because like
464,0,0,0.277333,i feel like these paintings i'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate
464,0,0,0.200625,you know it's like it's one of a kind and like it's it's there you know
464,0,0,0.266000,it's has own signature so
464,0,0,0.168750,so yeah i'm i'm pretty happy about that

376,1,12,0.370000,yes
376,1,12,0.239565,um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter>
376,1,12,0.227500,um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas
376,1,12,0.630000,um
376,1,12,0.289231,l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry
376,1,12,0.255000,and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a
376,1,12,0.276667,in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street
376,1,12,0.395000,so the
376,1,12,0.210000,yeah
376,1,12,0.270000,um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school
376,1,12,0.405000,but uh
376,1,12,0.269524,after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses
376,1,12,0.840000,um
376,1,12,0.234000,well i love the beach
376,1,12,0.281000,and i love the mountains i like to go hiking
376,1,12,0.243810,um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy
376,1,12,0.258000,no
376,1,12,0.182333,not at all
376,1,12,0.288750,um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger
376,1,12,0.323565,went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately
376,1,12,0.629000,um overseas
376,1,12,0.429000,um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit
376,1,12,0.223077,but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out
376,1,12,0.290000,<sniffle>
376,1,12,0.175333,oh that's alright
376,1,12,0.410000,gah
376,1,12,0.690000,um
376,1,12,0.163000,i don't have one
376,1,12,0.334000,to be honest um
376,1,12,0.285563,i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter>
376,1,12,0.320000,so
376,1,12,0.286154,um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment
376,1,12,0.230000,um as to if we wanna
376,1,12,0.309000,continue communicating with the person or not
376,1,12,0.294412,and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot
376,1,12,0.280000,so
376,1,12,0.437000,yes
376,1,12,0.732000,um
376,1,12,0.379000,i like watching movies
376,1,12,0.297720,i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book
376,1,12,0.403600,um not good at times i uh i have a
376,1,12,0.259750,some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get
376,1,12,0.400000,uh yesterday
376,1,12,0.406667,and it was with my partner
376,1,12,0.700000,and um
376,1,12,0.216231,actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just
376,1,12,0.321036,sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself
376,1,12,0.330000,so
376,1,12,0.773000,um
376,1,12,0.308217,at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind
376,1,12,0.269250,um i do not
376,1,12,0.296636,purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature
376,1,12,0.348000,but
376,1,12,0.268100,i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged
376,1,12,0.237000,so
376,1,12,0.758000,um
376,1,12,0.394667,uh last year my mother died
376,1,12,0.473000,so
376,1,12,0.253500,i wish i handled that differently
376,1,12,0.575000,um
376,1,12,0.260500,it upsets <ups> it's upsets me
376,1,12,0.340000,so
376,1,12,0.150000,it's okay
376,1,12,0.354000,um let me see
376,1,12,0.434500,<deep breath>
376,1,12,0.950000,uh <sigh>
376,1,12,0.298750,i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter>
376,1,12,0.210000,<sniffle>
376,1,12,0.319714,that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired
376,1,12,0.286182,but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because
376,1,12,0.413600,it's like i can't uh
376,1,12,0.224121,i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep
376,1,12,0.230909,um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind
376,1,12,0.352857,uh you know thinking about bills and
376,1,12,0.468000,and
376,1,12,0.265500,the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it
376,1,12,0.345688,uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode
376,1,12,0.509545,it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating
376,1,12,0.427000,everything so
376,1,12,0.268000,i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter>
376,1,12,0.211957,i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee
376,1,12,0.369000,yeah
376,1,12,0.415000,so other than that
376,1,12,0.469000,i'm
376,1,12,0.413000,i'm okay
376,1,12,0.448571,um well i've been i've been depressed
376,1,12,0.309250,for quite some time
376,1,12,0.353429,and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty
376,1,12,0.291250,uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died
376,1,12,0.395143,so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to
376,1,12,0.428944,get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do
376,1,12,0.327273,that i haven't done in a year because of what happened
376,1,12,0.486000,um i just
376,1,12,0.331933,i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat
376,1,12,0.670000,um
376,1,12,0.276364,i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep
376,1,12,0.277786,so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day
376,1,12,0.433857,yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis
376,1,12,0.327900,oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably
376,1,12,0.418000,ten to fifteen years ago
376,1,12,0.250000,and it's just something i've never
376,1,12,0.219750,gotten over i don't know whether or not
376,1,12,0.290125,you can so i've always taken the medicine
376,1,12,0.750000,um
376,1,12,0.725000,i was
376,1,12,0.351538,arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i
376,1,12,0.576800,was feeling desperate and hopeless
376,1,12,0.370000,and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago
376,1,12,0.358333,which caused me to be hospitalized
376,1,12,0.266667,and then uh
376,1,12,0.345556,they started treating me i started seeing a therapist
376,1,12,0.245000,so
376,1,12,0.335333,um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist
376,1,12,0.251500,but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some
376,1,12,0.275429,avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me
376,1,12,0.237765,i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there
376,1,12,0.250421,and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this
376,1,12,0.304286,and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback
376,1,12,0.350625,as to how to deal with the emotions
376,1,12,0.342750,tools to help you deal with your emotions
376,1,12,0.274000,so
376,1,12,0.584000,um
376,1,12,0.292071,like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication
376,1,12,0.590000,um
376,1,12,0.398800,there's been no changes really
376,1,12,0.303762,i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver
376,1,12,0.384000,and uh
376,1,12,0.293286,even though a lot of times i
376,1,12,0.492600,feeled i felt overwhelmed or
376,1,12,0.337571,lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her
376,1,12,0.610000,uh
376,1,12,0.230889,i still was a heck of a lot happier
376,1,12,0.219750,than i am now
376,1,12,0.350000,so
376,1,12,0.770000,um
376,1,12,0.503000,uh <sigh>
376,1,12,0.307400,i would say when my son was born years ago
376,1,12,0.292000,i'm not a parent anymore he passed away
376,1,12,0.443000,so
376,1,12,0.589000,um
376,1,12,0.305333,and that was difficult as well
376,1,12,0.227000,uh
376,1,12,0.250000,hmm
376,1,12,0.491100,um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me
376,1,12,0.262316,because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained
376,1,12,0.446500,and um
376,1,12,0.366000,you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible
376,1,12,0.308000,excuse me
376,1,12,0.272143,oh i have lots of regrets um
376,1,12,0.221357,uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about
376,1,12,0.279091,but um you know i met somebody once in my life
376,1,12,0.249769,that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker
376,1,12,0.690000,uh
376,1,12,0.379000,live to never regret
376,1,12,0.286714,so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation
376,1,12,0.221000,but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done
376,1,12,0.326875,um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really
376,1,12,0.279444,give my friends any kind of advice i mean
376,1,12,0.235067,i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother
376,1,12,0.604000,um
376,1,12,0.322000,i just state my opinion that's all
376,1,12,0.348250,um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating
376,1,12,0.309077,after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive
376,1,12,0.310909,i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot
376,1,12,0.272833,you know sleep eat sleep eat
376,1,12,0.285300,and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me
376,1,12,0.659000,um
376,1,12,0.163000,hmm

376,1,12,0.227444,i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now
